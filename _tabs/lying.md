This is the project landing page for Straight Cunts Lied ([StraightCuntsLied.com](https://straightcuntslied.com){:target="_blank"} and [StraightCuntsLied.org](https://straightcuntslied.org){:target="_blank"}).

You can watch my somewhat-frequent-but-no-promises adult online streams at [Chaturbate](https://chaturbate.hesaid.love){:target="_blank"} and [Stripchat](https://stripchat.hesaid.love){:target="_blank"}. They are probably extremely NSFW most of the time, but not guaranteed. I'm still working on ideas and you are more than welcome to [make suggestions](../pgp){:target="_blank"} I'm open-minded enough to try most things as long as they are biblical, which is determined by reading scripture and confirming with my Bro the Holy Spirit, not heresy taught by esteemed hypocrites like the ones you often find in churches. You might find me doing weird stuff like coding, 3D printing or reading humanity's bestseller. We can also just chat about a wide range of topics including but not limited to mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy and theology. Happy to engage in respectful discussions with one simple rule, we must let each other finish our sentences.

You can buy me a cup of coffee by visiting [my.club](https://myclub.hesaid.love/){:target="_blank"} (NSFW). The only thing you will ever receive is my wholehearted gratitude and a personal thank you. I will not say God bless. Whether the Lord blesses you is between Him, your conscience and you. I have no say in any of them as I learned by betrayal from everyone in my life. There will not be any special content and you get to view my stream recordings the same as everyone else who did not buy me coffee.

Long story short, I believed for the 27 years of my previous life that if God existed, then He would hate a rampant homosexual like me based purely on religious stereotypes. My life hit rock bottom in 2024 and I almost threw myself off the fifth-floor balcony right in front of my younger sister and He came to save me. I bought a humanity's bestseller a month prior after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay in Peterborough, United Kingdom for giving them free full-site Wi-Fi coverage because they were nice to me in the beginning and made me feel like an adopted son while my relationship with my biological family fell apart. I started reading the bestseller after a sequence of incomprehensible events which were described truthfully in my posts. I found out the straight cunts lied and they most likely failed not only maths and sciences but also reading comprehension in school.

If any esteemed hypocrites tell you God hates you because of who you are or what you did, show them [this post](../posts/on-homosexuality/){:target="_blank"}, inform them politely that they took the Lord's name in vain, and the Lord will not hold him guiltless. Know that you are loved. What the straight cunts do not know is some of us love getting poked in our buttholes, and some love poking buttholes, just as some hypocrites love hiking and some love travelling. We also spend significant effort in aftercare getting to know each other and exploring less abominable shared interests including but not limited to philosophy and theology. The love we have with each other could be out of genuine love and care for each other, rather than lust. That being said, there are also lying cunts in our community as documented in my journey and it is important to learn about discernment.

Everything can be simplified down to two rules and assuming you did not fail your logical reasoning and reading comprehension in school then you should be able to deduce the following. Don't be a cunt.

Whatever it is that you do, do it with love, faith and hope. Love always comes first. We had to learn how to love by ourselves because some illogical and illiterate straight cunts lied. They built their houses on the sand and we see the abomination of desolation that is modern academia and higher education today. Stupid cunts who could neither reason nor read are comparing theology with unicorns and fairytales.

God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Most importantly, God is love. Love is the greatest amount of sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask a father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.

1 John 4:7–12

God Is Love

[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. (ESV)

1 Corinthians 13

The Way of Love

[1] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. [2] And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. [3] If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

[4] Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant [5] or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; [6] it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. [7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

[8] Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. [11] When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.

[13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (ESV)

Matthew 22:34–40

The Great Commandment

[34] But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. [35] And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. [36] “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” [37] And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (ESV)
