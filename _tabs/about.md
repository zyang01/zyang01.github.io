🚨🚨🚨 Warning 🚨🚨🚨: If anyone tries to [refer me to mental health services](../posts/on-mental-illness-modern-psychology/){:target="_blank"} again without reading through all my posts, I’m gonna snitch on you to my Boss. Consider yourselves warned. 😠

If you experience [cognitive dissonance](../posts/on-cognitive-dissonance/){:target="_blank"} after reading my posts, feel free to reach out and I know people who could help. Apologies in advance for some of the language I used in my posts. I was quite angry when I wrote some of them. 🙏🫶😘

If you asked me what my thoughts were on religion before September 2024, I would have told you that I consider religion to be a [collective hallucination](../posts/on-god-collective-hallucination/){:target="_blank"} of sorts and a byproduct of evolution that brings about social benefits via community and companionships. The Holy Book is probably a collection of stories written by some really wise folks and some smart people in history did some overthinking and therefore we have the various religious institutions.

The enterprise of [scientific materialism](../posts/on-scientific-materialism/){:target="_blank"} I spent the first 27 years of my life building [collapsed on a Friday](../posts/on-holy-spirit-miracles/){:target="_blank"} in September 2024. Two days later, [I read Romans 1-4](../posts/on-my-conversion-homosexuality/){:target="_blank"} before going to my first Sunday church service and considered the Bible to be telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. In case there’s any doubt, I meant that both literally and figuratively.

Caught a flight from London to Hong Kong with three Bibles in my bag and no change of underwear on 2nd Oct 2024. I spoke with Pastor Xander at the Hong Kong Baptist Church before diving into mainland China for a three-day trip, and [I preached Jonah style](../posts/reasoning-behind-preaching-mainland-china-jonah-style/){:target="_blank"} 5-7 Oct 2024 at [three police stations](../posts/on-humble-pie/){:target="_blank"} in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing. Somehow, I managed to return to Hong Kong and [took a small break in Macau](../posts/on-quitting-smoking/){:target="_blank"} before [flying to California](../posts/on-confirmation/){:target="_blank"}. Preached to the choir from the West Coast to the East Coast. Flew from NYC to Rome on 20th Oct 2024, mistakenly thought I needed to [burn down a fig tree](../posts/reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/){:target="_blank"} that used to bear fruit, but is fruitless and only grows leaves nowadays. Learned that fig trees grow fruit before the leaves open after the fact.

It’s important to emphasise that even though my [scientific materialistic worldview](../posts/on-scientific-materialism/){:target="_blank"} collapsed, that doesn’t mean I no longer [believe in science](../posts/on-science/){:target="_blank"} anymore. I don’t think [God and science](../posts/on-faith-precedes-reason/){:target="_blank"} are conflicting at all, but somehow the two are stereotypically divided and I believe it’s time to unite the two rather than continue the divide.

His existence is [a posteriori knowledge and precedes cogito, ergo sum](../posts/on-knowing-believing/){:target="_blank"} for me. I suspect [His existence is an axiom in Gödel's incompleteness theorems](../posts/on-gdel-incompleteness-theorems/){:target="_blank"} for our universe. He is indeed the King of Kings after all.

I sincerely hope [I'm wrong about everything](https://letter.hesaid.love/){:target="_blank"} and I have simply gone absolutely batshit crazy and full of puppy poop. Otherwise, have fun on that Day.

Also, I seek advice from people, but I only seek guidance from Him. Glory belongs to Him. I'm just a servant. 🙏🫶😘

Best time of my life. 🥹😬😍🤩🥳😱🤣
