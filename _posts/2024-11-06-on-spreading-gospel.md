Matthew 7:6

[6] “Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.

The gospel is not something I can easily spread no matter how much I would like to. I think it’s written somewhere in scripture that only His chosen people will accept it, or something like that. Please don’t quote me on that, haven’t read the whole thing yet. 🙏

I consider the gospel to be holy and pearl like. I dunno if you’re His chosen people or not, could also be the other two. 🤷🤔😘
