It’s funny how some people just by default refer me to mental health services without looking at the objective facts and data that I’m laying out in front of them.

While some after looking still choose to turn away, and blame it on pure chance or coincidence even though the actual odds are astronomically small. That’s usually when they start talking about confirmation bias or refuse to think altogether.

I guess it is indeed true that people love sins more than the idea that there is a righteous God and He will come back to judge the world one day.

2 Timothy 3:1-7

Godlessness in the Last Days

[1] But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. [2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5] having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. [6] For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, [7] always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.

Once again, salvation is as easy as repentance by sincere recognition of one’s fault. My boss has already paid the price on the cross at checkout. It’s on the house and free!!!

As always, be blessed and best wishes. 🙏🫶😘

Edit: if anyone tries to refer me to mental health services again without reading through all my posts, I’m gonna tell on you to my heavenly Father. Consider yourselves warned. 😠
