The last couple of days were quite rough even after everything that I went through in the last year or so. I woke up earlier this evening after taking a nap and tried asking a couple of friends for help again. I cried for about an hour after.

Like in the Book of Jonah, I told Him I give up and please take my life away.

I have always wondered who I am or what I am my entire life.

I finally have the answer tonight. I'm a love story.

Let the story begin.

2 Corinthians 5:17

[17] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
