My faithful theologian friend mentioned that my three not-so-tiny steps in the policy agenda sound more like a charity than a political party. During our consultation session yesterday, he used the analogy of eating with two knives, suggesting that a political party is for winning elections, which is inherently divisive and a wrong instrument for my goals. My faithful theologian friend also reminded me that Boss Man specialised in carpentry before starting His ministry at around age 30 and going on a 2,000-year paid leave after a workplace injury.

Frankly, I have zero interest in getting into public office, and there are more than enough pretentious Oxford grads in the UK Parliament quarrelling over futile efforts and vanity. I also cannot imagine myself as a politician. How could I exercise abominably with talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt whilst listening to sick Berlin techno ever again? A faithful gay friend who was perhaps a little bit too zealous for planting seeds also mentioned that his friends and colleagues do not like discussing politics.

I did more half-assed research with ChatGPT earlier today. I realised it was a genius idea from my faithful theologian friend. Who would attack a charity campaigning on love, faith and hope even if the campaigner is a delusional nutjob? Even the projects [Bible Says Love](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"} and [Straight Cunts Lied](../../cuntslied/){:target="_blank"} fall somewhat perfectly under a charitable umbrella. I know we need some rebranding before the next Spotify Ads campaign. I am also sure my faithful gay friend would have an easier time discussing a charitable cause after planting some seeds abominably.

I am taking the Faith Party treasurer to church tomorrow. The poor dude is getting fired for a job he held for less than 48 hours. But I have another elevator pitch to comfort him.

I also have sufficient motivation to resume my version of carpentry to fund the Faith Party Foundation.

Do you know how annoying it is to have a brain like mine?

Let's party like it's 1517 again.

## Psalm 34

Taste and See That the LORD Is Good

Of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, so that he drove him out, and he went away.

 [1] I will bless the LORD at all times;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his praise shall continually be in my mouth.  
 [2] My soul makes its boast in the LORD;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the humble hear and be glad.  
 [3] Oh, magnify the LORD with me,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let us exalt his name together!  

 **[4] I sought the LORD, and he answered me**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**and delivered me from all my fears.**  
 [5] Those who look to him are radiant,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their faces shall never be ashamed.  
 [6] This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and saved him out of all his troubles.  
 [7] The angel of the LORD encamps  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around those who fear him, and delivers them.  

 [8] Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good!  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!  
 [9] Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for those who fear him have no lack!  
 [10] The young lions suffer want and hunger;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.  

 [11] Come, O children, listen to me;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will teach you the fear of the LORD.  
 [12] What man is there who desires life  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and loves many days, that he may see good?  
 [13] Keep your tongue from evil  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your lips from speaking deceit.  
 [14] Turn away from evil and do good;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek peace and pursue it.  

 [15] The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his ears toward their cry.  
 [16] The face of the LORD is against those who do evil,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cut off the memory of them from the earth.  
 [17] When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and delivers them out of all their troubles.  
 [18] The LORD is near to the brokenhearted  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and saves the crushed in spirit.  

 [19] Many are the afflictions of the righteous,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD delivers him out of them all.  
 [20] He keeps all his bones;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one of them is broken.  
 [21] Affliction will slay the wicked,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.  
 [22] The LORD redeems the life of his servants;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned. (ESV)
