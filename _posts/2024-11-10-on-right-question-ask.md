I went back to Keble College, Oxford little over a week ago and attended a group discussion on assisted dying organised by Chaplain Max.

After an evening of rational reasoning and debate, I metaphorically flipped over the table and expressed the view that if I were a lawmaker working on the bill then there would be one article only - they have to read mankind’s best seller first before a decision can be made. Although I’m not sure the U.K. parliament needs another pretentious Oxford grad to add to the mess.

IMHO, I think we are all asking the wrong questions. I believe the right question to ask is - God?

And the answer is - God!
