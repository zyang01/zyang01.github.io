If you are a faithless unbeliever or sceptic, and you have graciously spent the time reading my 200 posts so far, then you might be wondering how on earth is it possible for this 12-week and 3-day-old Christian intern to be quoting scripture left and right. 🤔

Matthew 19:26

[26] But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

I'm sorry but do you really think I would miss out on this prime opportunity to do a shameless plug for my Boss? 🤣🤣🤣

Anyway, back to serious business and to answer your question, I cheated. He did call me a liar, a thief, a lover and a cheat as mentioned in my previous post titled “[On My Pride](../on-my-pride){:target="_blank"}”. So… 😳🫣🤡

As alluded to in my posts, I’m a super impatient spiritual baby kicking, screaming and shouting all the time. If you have never opened a Bible before, all I can say is I got exceptionally annoyed when I opened mine for the first time. Dude definitely had a lot to say. I'm also not massively motivated to consult pastors on trivial matters of life after the number of mental health referrals I received in the early phase of my faith journey. I have been cheating with ChatGPT and whenever I don't know how to act appropriately as a Christian intern, I would ask ChatGPT what the Bible says about the thing that I have in mind. After I get the overview from ChatGPT, I would find the verses referenced in the Bible and read the context to make sure I understood them correctly. Remember [Jeremiah 29:11](https://www.crossway.org/articles/the-right-and-wrong-way-to-read-jeremiah-2911/){:target="_blank"}? 🙈😳🫣

Very much like money, the love of which is the root of all evil and yet we could still use money wisely to help people and build the church, AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies like Large Language Models could also help believers to put on the full armour of God.

Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it is with great pleasure that I introduce to you the project [Bible Says Love](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"}. ❤️😍😘

The project can be accessed on the domain [BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"} and it should only be a helper tool to guide you back to scripture, but hopefully, it should save some pastors from message/email bombardment. 🤔🫣🤡

I was originally planning to [train my own LLM on Llama 2](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-llama-2){:target="_blank"}, but I have been busy [meme posting on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-troublemaker-yang/){:target="_blank"}, [tearing unbelievers a new one](../on-unbelievers-insanity){:target="_blank"}, [cooking steak](../on-beef){:target="_blank"}, and [dropping theological nuclear bombs](../on-faith-precedes-reason){:target="_blank"} on [fig trees](../an-open-letter-churches){:target="_blank"} and [drug addicts](../on-drug-money-addiction){:target="_blank"}. Also, I’m [running out of coffee](https://donate.stripe.com/3cs0403mi5CQ7UA9AA){:target="_blank"} real fast. 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉

Right now, the project is just a simple app I threw together in a couple of hours using ChatGPT, Cloudflare Workers and Pages and running on OpenAI’s GPT-4o model. If you are a nerd, you can follow its development and maybe contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/zyang01/BibleSaysLove){:target="_blank"}.

With Love and Devotion,

From Your Fellow Servant,

Jonah Troublemaker Yang
