The movie 2012 came out the year I started Chinese junior high school. I always thought the conspiracy theorist character Charlie Frost was pretty cool because he didn't run away from disaster and appreciated God's work despite death being the price he had to pay to see it.

I went to Jerusalem yesterday and got scammed at the Jewish Quarter when I was walking towards Mount Zion from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The amount was 300 shekels, and as a result, I couldn't check into the hotel that I originally booked.

I guess I have done all that I could at this point, and I give zero fuck as to what happens next. Time to sit back, relax and watch the world burn after working non-stop for 28 years of my life and putting every motherfucker, including my parents, siblings, friends and strangers, first.

Go fuck yourselves, every single one of you.
