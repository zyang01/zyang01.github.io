Matthew 5:16

[16] In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

So here we go. The first pic is the two dozen I dropped off at my former employerâ€™s. Each one is signed, dated and labelled for the respective recipient with a personal message.

Finally, if you see the flood coming and you are already in the ark, but most people you care about still going about like all is well, would you not try your best to save them?

Matthew 24:37-39

[37] For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [38] For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, [39] and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
