In case you haven't figured that out yourself through reading my posts, I have confirmation from my Boss and He told me I'm so insane. He also told me to shut up and just enjoy this feelin’.

So I guess you better lock all your windows and doors if you are an unbeliever because this insane 10-week-old Christian intern is gonna find you, and preach to you. 😬🤪👻

Isaiah 50:7

[7] But the Lord GOD helps me;

therefore I have not been disgraced;

therefore I have set my face like a flint,

and I know that I shall not be put to shame.

Romans 1:16-17

The Righteous Shall Live by Faith

[16] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. [17] For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”

Matthew 5:11-12

[11] “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

2 Corinthians 12:10

[10] For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

2 Chronicles 36:16

[16] But they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD rose against his people, until there was no remedy.
