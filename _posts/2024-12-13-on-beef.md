As alluded to in my previous post titled “On Impudence, UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018”, I dropped two dozen mankind’s best sellers in envelopes marked private and confidential at the post office. In a strategic mistake, I alerted management in advance and apologised for the inconvenience.

I learned yesterday that the envelopes were refused at the recipients’ address. I just got out of Mount Pleasant Delivery Office and was informed that the envelopes are heading to Belfast for destruction, but there is a non-zero probability that I could get them back by calling customer service.

Perhaps management should read my origin story on real-life-fantasy(dot)com and contemplate why it's not really wise to mess with people who pick a fight with nature due to boredom and give a gay/bi naturist campsite free full-site wifi coverage in three months with zero prior camping/caravaning experience. I cooked solid-state fuel and launched rockets back in high school.

They gonna wish they just signed for the envelopes yesterday and distributed them quietly.

Before you get on the dance floor, you might wanna google my Boss and learn about what He did, but let's dance if you so desperately want to. I'm gonna have so much fun and it might just be the hot topic they whisper next to the water fountain this Christmas season.

Consider we have beef.

Matthew 10:16

Persecution Will Come

[16] “Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
