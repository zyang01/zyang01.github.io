If you took the time to contemplate on the topics mentioned in my previous post titled “On Scientific Materialism”, then you should be experiencing an existential crisis of sorts and wondering what can you know for certain to be real other than the fact that you are thinking and therefore you know you exist.

If you think about it, it requires faith for you to believe the reality you are sensing is real, otherwise you can’t even be certain whether you are just a brain in a jar and some evil scientist is messing with your sensory inputs.

I asked Him to teach me how to have strong enough faith to walk on water. I do wonder what it would feel like when that day comes. 🫣😬🫨

Matthew 14:25-33

[25] And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. [26] But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear. [27] But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.”

[28] And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” [29] He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. [30] But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, “Lord, save me.” [31] Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?” [32] And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. [33] And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
