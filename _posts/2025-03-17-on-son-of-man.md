I was feasting on delicious noodles I bought yesterday after selling two overkill high-end SSDs in the last hour. A scary thought entered my mind when I was devouring the noodles. Could Boss Man be talking about the same person in Luke 11:29-32?

## Luke 11:29–32

The Sign of Jonah

[29] When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. [30] For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. [32] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. (ESV)

Unless there has been a major breakthrough in [CRISPR-Cas9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing){:target="_blank"}-related technologies that I am unaware of, I believe everyone is a son or daughter of a man.

At the beginning of this journey, I wondered whether the Son of Man wanted to finish reading the bestseller because it gets scary when things get too magical. The bestseller is also long-ass. Could that be why no one knows that day or hour? The Son of Man is human. And it would be an understandable sentiment for a fellow human being. That could be the case if the Son of Man is amongst us without knowing he is the Son of Man.

## Matthew 24:36–39

No One Knows That Day and Hour

[36] “But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. [37] For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [38] For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, [39] and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. (ESV)

For some weird reason, the following verse keeps calling and motivating me, unlike [the antichrists](../on-revelation-13/#antichrist-not-christian){:target="_blank"} pretending to be Christians who informed me the desire to save people is a sign of pride.

---

## Matthew 24:22

[22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. (ESV)

I don't know about the Son of Man. But I intend to finish reading the bestseller, start a political party in the United Kingdom, and save some rampant homosexuals this year. Totally unrelated to the following verse, I also found little faith and caught a bunch of false teachers and antichrists. I wonder what kind of shitshow the Son of Man will find. That day will be fun for sure.

---

## Luke 18:8

[8] I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” (ESV)

Also, are you fucking telling me no one has walked in His statues in the last 2,000 fucking years?

If you are [an antichrist](../on-revelation-13/#antichrist-not-christian){:target="_blank"} pretending to be a Christian, feel free to let me know whether I accidentally climbed the Hall of Faith on my second week as a believer. I give zero fuck what you think if you don't know what the Hall of Faith is.
