Initially, I had the name Restore Faith Party in mind, but the domain name restore.faith costs over £500, and I could barely afford a cup of vanilla latte with coconut milk. By the grace of God, I managed to secure the domain name [FaithParty.org](https://www.faithparty.org/){:target="_blank"} earlier this morning for $7.66 (£5.91), the price of a cup of vanilla latte with coconut milk at London RPI with spare change. As a [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} developer, I'm also a gigantic [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming){:target="_blank"} (FP) fanboy.

I am working on the [RP1 GB form](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-06/RP1%20GB%20updated%20May%202023.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Application to register a political party in Great Britain). Due to my poor history of managing personal finance, I would raise more than a few eyebrows if I signed up to be the treasurer. I asked a faithful new friend if he would like the honour. I wanted to put down the Lord as the party leader, but I do not have the postcode for His current address. I am also reluctant to ask for His telephone number and email address. Therefore, I disgracefully nominated myself for the interim position. Hopefully, this will be the last time I try over-employment. I almost threw myself off the balcony last year.

I have been working on the party emblem and have three draft designs. ChatGPT kept rebelling against my instruction to reflect the full party slogan—"Love in Action. Faith in People. Hope for the Future."—in the design. I resorted to asking my new faithful friend again if he had any faithful artist friends who might be interested. The gig would be fully credited. The down payment is in the form of a bestseller with a full invoice paid on an unknown future date if they charge above-market premium rates.

I cheated again by asking ChatGPT to write the draft party constitution. Frankly, I could not have done it better myself. It's slightly longer than one page, but considering the legal and formal language involved, it's still better than [Conservative's 58](https://public.conservatives.com/organisation-department/202101/Conservative%20Party%20Constitution%20%20as%20amended%20January%202021.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [Labour's 146](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rule-Book-2024.pdf){:target="_blank"}. You have to give credit where credit is due. The [full version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible){:target="_blank"} and more details can be found on humanity's bestseller.
