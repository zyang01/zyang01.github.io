Initially, I had the name Restore Faith Party in mind, but the domain name restore.faith costs over ¬£500, and I could barely afford a cup of vanilla latte with coconut milk. By the grace of God, I managed to secure the domain name [FaithParty.org](https://www.faithparty.org/){:target="_blank"} earlier this morning for $7.66 (¬£5.91), the price of a cup of vanilla latte with coconut milk at London RPI with spare change. As a [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} developer, I'm also a gigantic [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming){:target="_blank"} (FP) fanboy.

I am working on the [RP1 GB form](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-06/RP1%20GB%20updated%20May%202023.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Application to register a political party in Great Britain). Due to my poor history of managing personal finance, I would raise more than a few eyebrows if I signed up to be the treasurer. I asked a faithful new friend if he would like the honour. I want the Lord to be the party leader, but I do not have the postcode for His current address. I am also reluctant to ask for His telephone number and email address. Therefore, I disgracefully nominated myself for the interim position. Hopefully, this will be the last time I try over-employment. I almost threw myself off the balcony when I did that last time.

## Draft Launch Manifesto

We make zero effort to pretend we have the answers and solutions to all our problems. No single human being in our party makes any final decisions. Only God has the final say. We reason within the boundaries and understanding He gives us. We will make mistakes. We are all flawed and imperfect, like the first man who sinned against God. We operate on one and only one law - love.

The definition of love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.

### Romans 13:8‚Äì14

Fulfilling the Law Through Love

[8] Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, ‚ÄúYou shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,‚Äù and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.‚Äù [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

[11] Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. [12] The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. [13] Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. [14] But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires. (ESV)

Our long-term goal is to restore faith in everyone's heart so that we don't, by default, assume the worst of each other. We want to build a society where we, by default, presume the best of each other. We don't know how to achieve that (yet), but we can start with a tiny step at a time.

The three not-so-tiny steps we currently have on [the agenda](../on-money-and-fiscal-policy/){:target="_blank"} are the following.

Shelter God's children by taking them off the streets, feeding and putting a roof over them.

Reunite communities, including but not limited to LGBTQIA+, with God and let them know they are loved too.

Prepare humanity to defend against [the socioeconomic tsunami](https://letter.hesaid.love/){:target="_blank"} brought about by Artificial Intelligence we have never seen before. We sincerely hope we are wrong, but we face significant unemployment rates and suffering globally for the bottom 90%.

## Draft Party Emblem

I have been working on the party emblem and have three draft designs. ChatGPT kept rebelling against my instruction to reflect the full party slogan‚Äî"Love in Action. Faith in People. Hope for the Future."‚Äîin the design. I resorted to asking my faithful new friend again if he had any faithful artist friends who might be interested. The gig would be fully credited. The down payment is in the form of a bestseller with a full invoice paid on an unknown future date if they charge above-market premium rates.

### Edit

After checking out the emblems of [existing political parties](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/political-registration-and-regulation/political-party-registration){:target="_blank"} and double-checking with ChatGPT, I learned that party emblems submitted to the Electoral Commission for use on ballot papers must be in black and white. So here is the fourth draft. ChatGPT was reluctant to clean up the image for me again. It's seriously starting to annoy the heck out of me. üôÑ

### Edit Again

I took a nap and just woke up feeling annoyed again at ChatGPT. It kept refusing to clean up the 2020s on both sides of the emblem and arrange the slogan as I instructed. As I was lying in bed listening to Ed Sheeran's [_Thinking out Loud_](https://open.spotify.com/track/34gCuhDGsG4bRPIf9bb02f?si=9f2626232c204b37){:target="_blank"}, I remembered the year 2020 was when I had my first calling. It was the first and only time I tried [MDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA){:target="_blank"} in my life, and I messaged my friend. We [matriculated](../on-confirmation/){:target="_blank"} at [Keble College, Oxford](../on-more-interesting-coincidences/){:target="_blank"} together. Her father is a Christian missionary in mainland China, who He told me to talk to, and He said the answers are there. As someone with a pretty severe [OCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder){:target="_blank"}, I like keeping records, and I found the messages I sent five years ago on WeChat. I had not even touched a humanity's bestseller before then, let alone reading it. If you don't read simplified Chinese, I used the pronoun 'It' rather than 'He'. The mobile app version of Google Translate has a camera function that you can use. You tell me if He exists.

I had to do a reality check every morning, even in January this year. I would contemplate whether the last several months did happen, whether I had gone batshit crazy and if I should check into a mental hospital. Dude unscrewed and removed the door for me at this point. I cannot shut the door even if I want to. There is no going back. You cannot run away from God.

Now you know why [I don't do MDMA](../on-drugs/){:target="_blank"}.

And yes, I am fully aware of the implications of what I just publically admitted to. What did I say about telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno?

## Draft Party Constitution

I cheated again by asking ChatGPT to write the draft party constitution. Frankly, I could not have done it better myself. It's slightly longer than one page, but considering the legal and formal language involved, it's still better than [Conservative's 58](https://public.conservatives.com/organisation-department/202101/Conservative%20Party%20Constitution%20%20as%20amended%20January%202021.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [Labour's 146](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rule-Book-2024.pdf){:target="_blank"}. You have to give credit where credit is due. The [full version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible){:target="_blank"} and more details can be found on humanity's bestseller.
