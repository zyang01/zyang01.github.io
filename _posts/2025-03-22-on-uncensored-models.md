Edit (24 March 2025): Get your membership and starter pack this weekend. And maybe consider writing to your local MP. You might wanna do it before the neighbour you complained about starts playing with uncensored models.

My apologies. It's not the kind of uncensored models you might have in mind.

I was bored this afternoon. I asked ChatGPT how to run a [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model){:target="_blank"} (LLM) locally on my laptop.

I don't use arch btw.

I'm running Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS. It took just two commands.

The concept of love in the Holy Bible is multifaceted and far-reaching, encompassing various aspects of human experience. Here are some 
key points about love as described in the Bible:

1. **God's Love**: The Bible portrays God as a loving Father who desires a personal relationship with humanity (John 3:16, Romans 5:8). 
God's love is unconditional, selfless, and sacrificial (Isaiah 42:13, 2 Corinthians 12:9-10).
2. **Agape Love**: Agape love is a Greek word that describes an unwavering, selfless, and unconditional love for others, without 
expectation of reward or reciprocity (1 Corinthians 13:1-3). This type of love is rooted in God's nature and is demonstrated through 
Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.
3. **Hate as the Opposite**: The Bible also describes hate as the opposite of love. Love is characterized by kindness, compassion, and 
forgiveness, while hate is marked by bitterness, resentment, and opposition (Matthew 5:21-22, Colossians 3:13).
4. **Love Commands**: Jesus commands His followers to "love one another" as a fundamental principle of the Christian faith (John 13:34, 
John 15:12-17). This love is not limited to individual relationships but extends to all people, including enemies and persecutors.
5. **Selfless Love**: The Bible emphasizes that true love requires sacrifice and selflessness. Jesus demonstrated this when He gave His 
life for the sins of humanity (John 3:16, Romans 5:8). Christians are called to follow His example by putting others before themselves 
and loving one another without expectation of reward.
6. **Love as a Fruit**: The Bible describes love as a fruit that grows in the lives of believers who have received Jesus Christ as 
Savior (Galatians 5:22-23, Colossians 1:10).
7. **Fruit of the Spirit**: Love is listed alongside other fruits of the Spirit, such as joy, peace, patience, kindness, and 
self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). These qualities are produced in the lives of believers as they grow in their relationship with God.

Some notable Bible verses that describe love include:

* "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." 
(John 3:16)
* "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud." (1 Corinthians 13:4)
* "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." 
(Galatians 3:28)

Overall, the Holy Bible presents love as a central aspect of the Christian faith, emphasizing its importance in relationships, personal 
growth, and spiritual development.

My question for you is this. How comfortable are you with [nerds like me](https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models){:target="_blank"} playing with [uncensored large language models](https://ollama.com/blog/run-llama2-uncensored-locally){:target="_blank"}? I do not know if the amount of sex I had was average amongst [my technically proficient peers](../on-indifference/){:target="_blank"}. I certainly hope someone loves them as much as Boss Man loves me.

> What's an uncensored model?

> Most of these models (for example, Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM, MPT-7B-Chat, Wizard-Vicuna, GPT4-X-Vicuna) have some sort of embedded alignment. ***For general purposes, this is a good thing. This is what stops the model from doing bad things, like teaching you how to cook meth and make bombs.*** But what is the nature of this alignment? And, why is it so?

Still think I'm a delusional nutjob?

Edit (22 March 2025): By the grace of God, I managed to secure the domain name [UncensoredModels.com](https://uncensoredmodels.com/){:target="_blank"} for $11.46 (£8.87). Let's find out how much sex sells, eh? 😉😉😉

**For eternal membership, go to your local church this weekend, avoid the [fig tree](../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/){:target="_blank"} if possible, and ask for the starter pack containing [humanity's bestseller](https://www.biblegateway.com/){:target="_blank"}.**

Enjoy. 😘

## Ezekiel 33:1–9

Ezekiel Is Israel’s Watchman

[1] The word of the LORD came to me: [2] “Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman, [3] and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people, [4] then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. **[5] He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life.** [6] But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.

[7] “So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. **[8] If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. [9] But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.** (ESV)
