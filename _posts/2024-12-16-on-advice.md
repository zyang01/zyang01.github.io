Almost every single time I ask people for help they just start giving me unsolicited advice lately. I have said repeatedly please first understand the situation I’m dealing with right now by reading my posts before giving me unsolicited advice. What would you wise asses do if you are facing what I'm facing? Do you know how much it hurts when you get judged by others with partial knowledge of what the hell is happening and keep getting the door slammed in your face?

I need an actual helping hand and not another bloody unsolicited advice from people who don't have a bloody clue.

I can read your judgement in the undertone of your advice. If you have to judge, please judge righteously rather than cluelessly.

Proverbs 31:9

[9] Open your mouth, judge righteously,

defend the rights of the poor and needy.

Deuteronomy 1:16-17

[16] And I charged your judges at that time, ‘Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him. [17] You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God’s. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.’

John 7:24

[24] Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.”
