Wake up 4/5 AM naturally and say good morning to Him.

Go for a walk listening to music and see what revelations come through until about sunrise.

Shower, get breakfast, thank Him through the Lordâ€™s Prayer and ask Him for strength and courage to overcome.

Maybe take a nap before 9 AM if Iâ€™m still a bit tired.

Start my day and say roughly three things: yes boss, okay boss, your wish is my command boss. Admire His majestic creation from time to time, and think about what He would keep and burn down when He comes back. I think Heâ€™s probably not gonna keep the gigantic fig tree in Rome. ðŸ¤”

Be salt of the earth and flood peopleâ€™s morning LinkedIn coffee scroll with Chinese panda memes whilst spreading the gospel in my free time.

Go to bed around 8/9 PM, say good night to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and hug my bible to sleep.
