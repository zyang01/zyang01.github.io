I'm not massively sure how educated John of Patmos, the author of the Book of Revelation, was on the subject of chromatics, the study of colour, and I wonder how he would describe the colours on Cloudflare’s logo.

I did a quick search on Google, and the two main colours on Cloudflare’s logo are Princeton orange and yellow orange. Naturally, I wondered what the Bible says about oranges so I asked that using [BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"} and turns out the cultivation of oranges likely began in southeast Asia and they were not introduced to the Mediterranean region until centuries after the Bible was written. There is zero mention of oranges in the Bible.

I also wonder if a couple billion strongly worded letters will be loud enough and how the stonks will react. From the feedback I have received so far, I managed to freak a bunch of people out including computer scientists from Imperial College London and King’s College London.

Good luck with your stonk portfolio if you have one, and happy new year. 🙏🫶😘
