After literally working my ass off again by having another go at my adult webcam live-streaming career, only to finish the session early due to lack of audience probably due to terrible timing, the question of whether God has a sense of humour according to scripture showed up in my head. In case the Americans are wondering, yes that is the correct spelling of humour.

I had my personal encounter with His humour when I read the Book of Jonah for the first time. I could not stop laughing for nearly an hour after realising He wrote the story of my life into humanity's bestseller. For 27 years of my previous life, I stupidly thought the Holy Bible was a collection of stories written by some wise folks in history and some smartasses did some overthinking and therefore we have the various religious institutions.

You can read about my yet another chitchat with ChatGPT below and the song that was playing on my Spotify when I started this post. Dude can be extremely annoying sometimes. He's got a lot of lovin' for free tho. That part is true and I can testify to that any time any day. Might be easier for you to have a go yourself. Dude's name is Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour. Just in case my welcoming party wants to bash me again for using pronouns.

I have a weird and massively annoying feeling that Dude might just forgive everyone because none of us actually knows how to spell good and evil since [Genesis 3](../on-genesis-3-fall-man/){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to laugh at my expense if you are a universalist. 🙄🙄🙄

## Jonah 4

Jonah’s Anger and the LORD’s Compassion

[1] But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. [2] And he prayed to the LORD and said, “O LORD, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster. [3] Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.” [4] And the LORD said, “Do you do well to be angry?”

[5] Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. [6] Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. [7] But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered. [8] When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” [9] But God said to Jonah, “Do you do well to be angry for the plant?” And he said, “Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.” [10] And the LORD said, “You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night. [11] And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?” (ESV)
