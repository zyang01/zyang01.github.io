A former colleague informed me that certain languages in my recent posts could cause legal trouble for me.

Please allow me to remind everyone that I'm officially bankrupt, and as far as I'm aware, they offer free food and accommodation in prison. And to be honest, prison sex was a fantasy for me as a former rampant homosexual. Not to mention I would have all the time in the world to patiently finish reading mankindâ€™s best seller. ðŸ«¨

John 15:20

[20] Remember the word that I said to you: â€˜A servant is not greater than his master.â€™ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
