There were two more after the first one in late August.

The second one happened after the confession of my sexuality to the friend I reestablished contact with. He touched my back when my friend said a prayer in English immediately after speaking in tongues. It was a burning sensation and no mark was left.

The third one happened when I chased Him to Bristol after bothering Chaplain Beth at Regentâ€™s Park College, Oxford. The experience was sensorial and allowed me to derive the theory on the mark of the beast as detailed in one of my early posts.

Matthew 13:16-17

[16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. [17] For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
