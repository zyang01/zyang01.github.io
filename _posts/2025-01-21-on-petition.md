Find the knowledge of good and evil. What crime against humanity did I commit?  

Long story short, I'm 28 and my income was mid-six figures last April. I was effectively a single parent since COVID and paid for my two adult younger siblings' private and higher education in London. I nearly threw myself off the balcony on the fifth-floor in front of my sister back in August.  

I declared bankruptcy three months ago and started writing down my story on my blog, HeSaid.Love (HeSaidLove.com), and I have written 245 posts on topics including but not limited to mathematics, physics, computer science, psychology, economics, philosophy, performing arts, and theology. I was in Jerusalem last week, and I wanted to speak to a rabbi regarding the Book of Isaiah, but I ended up crying alone on Mount Zion. I would like to know if anyone still knows how to spell good and evil.
