As mentioned in my recent posts, I accidentally [stumbled across the Book of Isaiah](../on-holiday/){:target="_blank"} in the Old Testament three weeks ago. For about a week, I believed [I might be the suffering servant](../on-suffering-servant/){:target="_blank"} since Isaiah 52:13 through Isaiah 53:12 more accurately describes me personally than our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, when He showed up 2,000 years ago. I [ended up in Israel the week later](../on-judgement-day/){:target="_blank"} and mistakenly thought [I was going home](../on-going-home/){:target="_blank"}, but I [got scammed in Jerusalem](../on-2012/){:target="_blank"} on the first day for 300 shekels and could not check into the hotel I booked since [I ran out of money](../on-my-situation/){:target="_blank"}, yet again.

Before I travelled to Israel and when I was [checking references to call specific world leaders sexually promiscuous](../on-pgp/){:target="_blank"}, I found out Jonah is the [only one of the Twelve Minor Prophets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jonah){:target="_blank"} in the Hebrew Bible to be named in the Quran as well. I further went down the rabbit hole from the Wikipedia page for the Book of Jonah into [Typology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typology_(theology)#Example_of_Jonah){:target="_blank"} and [Exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis){:target="_blank"}. I have yet to emerge from the rabbit hole and will likely have more to say about these two fancy words later on, but as alluded to in my prior posts, humanity's best seller is the [closest thing to magic](../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/){:target="_blank"} I have experienced in 28 years of life. Before [almost pooping myself](../on-confirmation/){:target="_blank"} [yet again](../on-esther/){:target="_blank"}, [thanks to Isaiah](../on-mistake/){:target="_blank"} three weeks ago, I had only experienced the magic [through the New Testament](../on-pgp/){:target="_blank"}. I built the project [Bible Says Love](../on-cheating-bible-says-love/){:target="_blank"} to help me study Boss Man's knowledge and wisdom. You can read about them in [my ~250 earlier posts](../../timeline/){:target="_blank"} with as much or as little scepticism as you want. [I don't give two shits](../on-love-faith-hope/){:target="_blank"} if a faithless motherfucker believes me or not.

I [read Isaiah 20 to 60 in reverse order](../on-isaiah-20-60/){:target="_blank"} over the weekend and found them too interesting. I enjoy walking into a brand-new adventure or exploration with zero knowledge and as little external influence as possible. I did that for the [four undergraduate degrees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-troublemaker-yang/details/education/){:target="_blank"} I studied in the last decade, and it's also the reason why [I bought a brand new caravan](../on-love-death/){:target="_blank"} with no prior camping or caravaning experience within two weeks last April. And therefore, I got increasingly annoyed when I realised I could comprehend the super annoying texts and map them into the real world. I find them irritating because those words have the weird ability to give me the sense that the more I understand them, the greater the yet-to-be-revealed mysteries behind them are. I believe it's known as the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect){:target="_blank"}, and you should read about the effect if you have yet to experience it.

I spent today reading [Isaiah 22 with modern interpretations on BibleRef](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/22/Isaiah-22-1.html){:target="_blank"} since I did not pay attention at all in history classes when I was in school. I needed to scratch my itch after comprehending the texts on an abstract and metaphysical level and correlating them to real-world events. Learning from [modest scholars, scribes, and Pharisees](../on-fat-man-little-boy-dr-modest/){:target="_blank"} would not necessarily [be that bad](../on-academia/){:target="_blank"}. I kept signing and shaking my head as I worked through Isaiah 22 on BibleRef. As it turns out, Isaiah and I had a lot more in common than [exposing our nakedness](../on-isaiah-20-60/){:target="_blank"} to the world. Beer will be on me when I meet him in heaven; it must also be German beer. I could not comprehend why anyone would enjoy the bitter AF German beer in my previous life. Now I can.

There were [countless times in the last 18 weeks](../on-what-i-want/){:target="_blank"} when I wanted to burn the world and capitalism down and hated the coldness of hearts of the people who I once thought were my friends. I kicked, screamed and shouted to call for repentance and [took away reason](../on-faith-precedes-reason/){:target="_blank"} from underneath their feet. None turned around and [continued taking drugs](../on-drug-money-addiction/){:target="_blank"}. I have realised now that there is no need for me to be angry or worked up since they have already [condemned themselves to death](../on-we-all-die/){:target="_blank"} by [choosing a lie](../on-genesis-3-fall-man/){:target="_blank"}, evil and unrighteousness for profit over [God, truth, reason and love](../on-eternal-life/){:target="_blank"}. Isaiah and I will have a minute of silence and remembrance over your death before enjoying our beer and laughing at your demise and stupidity.

After reading the interpretation of Isaiah 22 on BibleRef, I felt tired and speechless. If I were [Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/22/Isaiah-22-20.html){:target="_blank"}, I would shut the gates after shouting for 18 weeks, and none came, and throw the key away. I did not intend to read Isaiah 23, but then I saw the [ships of Tarshish](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/23/Isaiah-23-1.html){:target="_blank"} mentioned. [Jonah fell asleep on a ship to Tarshish](https://www.esv.org/Jonah+1/){:target="_blank"} when he [tried to run away](../reasoning-behind-preaching-mainland-china-jonah-style/){:target="_blank"} from the Lord.

I returned to London from Israel on Saturday, a little over a week ago. Modern-day Israel is the city of Tyre, and Jerusalem is filled with merchants and crooks. Israel and the house of Judah have whored her youth for riches and prostituted herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. The [spyware used by Saudi Arabia](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/khashoggis-widow-sues-israeli-spyware-company-nso-over-phone-hacking-2023-06-16/){:target="_blank"} to hack Jamal Khashoggi's phone and contributed to [the journalist's brutal murder](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399){:target="_blank"} was made in Israel by cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group. [Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate](../on-fear/){:target="_blank"} in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 and never came out. A hit team dismembered his body. According to reports, a particular head of state "did not have any knowledge" about the incident, and the [returned golden calf was OK with his FWB](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46283355){:target="_blank"} as long as he could afford $450bn.

I seriously need to take a chill pill, especially after pulling all-nighters consecutively in the last few weeks. I'm going to [have some fun with my FWBs](../on-my-salvation/){:target="_blank"}. Rest assured. There is no [root of all evil](../on-two-masters-god-money/){:target="_blank"} involved—just some good old [mechanical movement](../on-my-peculiarities-extremely-nsfw/){:target="_blank"} with written consent from all involved parties.
I am looking forward to taking care of [the Assyrians](../on-academia/){:target="_blank"} soon and watching them bury their heads in the sand by taking away reason from underneath their feet. Did you know that [they probably invented the wheel](https://thefierceassyrians.weebly.com/science-and-technology.html){:target="_blank"}? The Assyrians were a bright bunch and made significant advancements in mathematics, astronomy, medicine and technology during their advancement in warfare. Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire.

Isaiah 31:8–9

[8] “And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man;
    and a sword, not of man, shall devour him;
and he shall flee from the sword,
    and his young men shall be put to forced labor.
[9] His rock shall pass away in terror,
    and his officers desert the standard in panic,”
declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion,
    and whose furnace is in Jerusalem. (ESV)
