In hindsight and looking back at the first 27 years of my life when I was an agnostic, I realised even at the lowest points where I thought it was me against my whole world including my parents, He was always there.

When He came to save me back in late August, the song through which He baptised me with the Holy Spirit was “Glad You Came” by The Wanted. The song came out in 2011 when I was in Chinese junior high school, a time when I stuck out like a sore thumb and felt like I was a lone sheep walking in the opposite direction of the flock, around the same time I started listening to the song.

I will take that jump, take the pain, and give it all I have, just for Him.

“I Lived” - Song by OneRepublic, partial lyrics below.

Hope when you take that jump

You don't fear the fall

Hope when the water rises

You built a wall

Hope when the crowd screams out

It's screaming your name

Hope if everybody runs

You choose to stay

Hope that you fall in love

And it hurts so bad

The only way you can know

You give it all you have

And I hope that you don't suffer

But take the pain

Hope when the moment comes you'll say

I, I did it all

I, I did it all

I owned every second that this world could give

I saw so many places

The things that I did

Yeah, with every broken bone

I swear I lived
