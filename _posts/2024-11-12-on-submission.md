Before I came up with the theory regarding the mark of the beast in the book of revelation, as discussed in a previous post titled “On the Mark of the Beast”, I was terrified of the idea that what if I’m not on the good side considering the difference on the number of people who get saved at the end times compared to the number of Christians we have in the world.

The possibilities of me being a false prophet, an antichrist, and even satan also came across my mind. Then one day I realised, actually it doesn’t matter all that much and I don’t even care if He wants me to burn in hell for eternity, as long as His will is done.

I don’t even know why I would realise that. I guess when a man falls madly in love, logic goes straight into the bin or something? 🥲
