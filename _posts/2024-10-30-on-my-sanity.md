In case anyone is wondering, I have objectively gone beyond insane at this point.

The day before I entered mainland China to preach like Jonah did, I realised taking the leap of faith is the same as going insane. This is because you believe He will catch you rather than letting you smash into the ground based on faith and faith alone rather than reason or logic.

I have gone beyond insane at this point because I would take the leap of faith regardless of whether He will catch me, as long as there is a non-zero probability that all the suffering in this world would have meaning.

Why would I do that? Because He’s the only one who came when I was desperate and felt like I was drowning since no one has the time to hear me out anymore. Everyone was more concerned about chasing after money and we no longer care about each other despite the suffering. I would’ve killed myself if He didn’t come and save me.

I gave my loyalty and faithfulness to men and women, they trampled them under their feet, turned around and tore me apart. They just let me burn after taking everything from me. My loyalty and faithfulness belong to Him and Him only from now on.

Let’s get the party started. No amount of money will be able to buy you your salvation when He comes back.

Take care, best wishes and good luck.

For love and devotion.
