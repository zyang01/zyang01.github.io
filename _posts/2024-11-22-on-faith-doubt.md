He practically removed doubts in my mind to a degree that I can either have faith or I can have doubt, but I can't have both at the same time. The more I think, the more I seem to doubt, and the less faith I have, but He does always provide reassurance wherever and whenever I need it. My Father is super thoughtful. ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜˜

Proverbs 3:5-12

[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,

and do not lean on your own understanding. 

[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,

and he will make straight your paths. 

[7] Be not wise in your own eyes;

fear the LORD, and turn away from evil. 

[8] It will be healing to your flesh

and refreshment to your bones.

[9] Honor the LORD with your wealth

and with the firstfruits of all your produce; 

[10] then your barns will be filled with plenty,

and your vats will be bursting with wine.

[11] My son, do not despise the LORDâ€™s discipline

or be weary of his reproof, 

[12] for the LORD reproves him whom he loves,

as a father the son in whom he delights.
