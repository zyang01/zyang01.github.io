I would strongly advise everyone to contemplate which master they serve, either right now, tonight or this weekend.

Please also read my previous post titled “[On the Mark of the Beast](../on-the-mark-of-the-beast/){:target="_blank"}” and the [Book of Revelation](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/){:target="_blank"} as quickly as you possibly could.

Luke 16:13

[13] No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”

Matthew 24:36-39

No One Knows That Day and Hour

[36] “But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. [37] For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [38] For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, [39] and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
