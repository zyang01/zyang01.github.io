Yesterday was the second time someone told me that trying to save other people is a sign of pride. They also kindly informed me that I'm an egomaniac who believes that I might be a chosen one. Unlike the first time, it was slightly better this time since it came from a Christian. Although, does that make it worse? I don't know. I'm not sure I know how to spell good and evil anymore. Let me know if you know how to spell good and evil. Thanks.

Allegedly Christians like to ask the question what would Jesus do when facing ethical and moral choices, evidently it's called discipleship otherwise known as following Jesus. I would like to reiterate my position once again and make another apology in advance for the language I'm about to use since I noticed that no mother fucker tries to learn what happened first before opening their mouths and informing me of their fucking opinions. I had zero mother fucking desire to be the fucking messiah and I still have zero mother fucking desire to be the messiah. I don't know if I'm the fucking messiah, and you are more than fucking welcome to inform me about your fucking opinion after you learned what happened. I wrote them all down.

It's been 157 days since I believed, and throughout this journey, I realised the m-word is a big no-no to mention to believers. And you would automatically receive the labels including but not limited to egomaniac, megalomaniac and narcissist. I couldn't help but find it both ironic and sarcastic that Christians have been hoping for the second coming for over 2,000 years now and the immediate reaction they have when some random dude wants to show them evidence is to refer them to mental health services without bothering with glancing the evidence served up on a platter, despite the dude's only wish is to find out why life became magic and why people lost reasoning capabilities overnight. Frankly, speaking from the perspective of a rampant homosexual who has more sexual partners in an hour every other day than the average heterosexual will have in their entire life, I kinda feel bad for Boss Man given the stigma and discrimination attached to His job title. He did have a pretty rough time and went on a sabbatical not long after a pretty bad workplace injury. I will check with Him next time we speak to see how's that lawsuit preparation going and when He will be done with His career break. I'm pretty sure Dude's a worse procrastinator than me.

I kinda asked Him for some stupid stuff when I first learned how to pray including but not limited to letting me suffer and save some random people including but not limited to rampant homosexuals. Whether or not He will allow me to, I don't know. I trust Him and I did not trust myself even once in my entire life. He does tell me to stop working and go chill the fuck out somewhat regularly. The health insurance is pretty good with this Boss, and I heard a Colleague got injured three years into the job and Dude is still chilling on paid leave after 2,000 years. My former life ambition was to build an interesting tech startup and ideally work up to a net worth of 10-50 mil so that I could study and explore any extremely random interest that I somehow magically come up with every 3 to 6 months, and could still be in t-shirt and jeans without anyone bothering me. I was definitely on track with that with a mid-six-figure income at 27, then I tried to take my first holiday and you are reading about the ongoing nuclear fallout. I'm gonna work my ass off, both literally and figuratively, and see if I can also go on a sabbatical for something like forever and ever.

Feel free to get in touch after you find out about the m-word thing. To be honest, given how successfully we managed to fuck this up, I think the singular m-word might not be enough, and we might be able to unfuck this quicker if we start using the plural form. But it took decades for my community, some of whom are rampant homosexuals like me who enjoy getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno, to fight for our rights to be equal citizens of society, and we still face discrimination today. Statistically speaking, I think the m-word community will have a significantly harder time, but speaking from first-hand personal experience, statistics is a synonym for null in their dictionary.

Matthew 24:22

Matthew 24:15–22

The Abomination of Desolation

[15] “So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), [16] then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. [17] Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, [18] and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. [19] And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [20] Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. [21] For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. [22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. (ESV)

Matthew 12:7

[7] And if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. (ESV)

Matthew 9:9–13

Jesus Calls Matthew

[9] As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.

[10] And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. [11] And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” [12] But when he heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. [13] Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” (ESV)

Matthew 7:1–5

Judging Others

[1] “Judge not, that you be not judged. [2] For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. [3] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [4] Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? [5] You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye. (ESV)

Luke 12:13–14

The Parable of the Rich Fool

[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” [14] But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” (ESV)

Hosea 6

Israel and Judah Are Unrepentant

 [1] “Come, let us return to the LORD;<br>
  for he has torn us, that he may heal us;<br>
  he has struck us down, and he will bind us up.<br>
 [2] After two days he will revive us;<br>
  on the third day he will raise us up,<br>
  that we may live before him.<br>
 [3] Let us know; let us press on to know the LORD;<br>
  his going out is sure as the dawn;<br>
 he will come to us as the showers,<br>
  as the spring rains that water the earth.”<br>

 [4] What shall I do with you, O Ephraim?<br>
  What shall I do with you, O Judah?<br>
 Your love is like a morning cloud,<br>
  like the dew that goes early away.<br>
 [5] Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets;<br>
  I have slain them by the words of my mouth,<br>
  and my judgment goes forth as the light.<br>
 [6] For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,<br>
  the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.<br>

 [7] But like Adam they transgressed the covenant;<br>
  there they dealt faithlessly with me.<br>
 [8] Gilead is a city of evildoers,<br>
  tracked with blood.<br>
 [9] As robbers lie in wait for a man,<br>
  so the priests band together;<br>
 they murder on the way to Shechem;<br>
  they commit villainy.<br>
 [10] In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;<br>
  Ephraim’s whoredom is there; Israel is defiled.<br>

 [11] For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.<br>

 When I restore the fortunes of my people, (ESV)<br>

Genesis 18:22–33

Abraham Intercedes for Sodom

[22] So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD. [23] Then Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? [24] Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? [25] Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?” [26] And the LORD said, “If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”

[27] Abraham answered and said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. [28] Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” [29] Again he spoke to him and said, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.” [30] Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.” [31] He said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.” [32] Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.” [33] And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place. (ESV)

Ezekiel 22:29–31

[29] The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice. [30] And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. [31] Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.” (ESV)

Jeremiah 5:1–5

Jerusalem Refused to Repent

 [1] Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem,<br>
  look and take note!<br>
 Search her squares to see<br>
  if you can find a man,<br>
 one who does justice<br>
  and seeks truth,<br>
 that I may pardon her.<br>
 [2] Though they say, “As the LORD lives,”<br>
  yet they swear falsely.<br>
 [3] O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth?<br>
 You have struck them down,<br>
  but they felt no anguish;<br>
 you have consumed them,<br>
  but they refused to take correction.<br>
 They have made their faces harder than rock;<br>
  they have refused to repent.<br>

 [4] Then I said, “These are only the poor;<br>
  they have no sense;<br>
 for they do not know the way of the LORD,<br>
  the justice of their God.<br>
 [5] I will go to the great<br>
  and will speak to them,<br>
 for they know the way of the LORD,<br>
  the justice of their God.”<br>
 But they all alike had broken the yoke;<br>
  they had burst the bonds. (ESV)<br>

Isaiah 59:14–17

Judgment and Redemption

 [14] Justice is turned back,<br>
  and righteousness stands far away;<br>
 for truth has stumbled in the public squares,<br>
  and uprightness cannot enter.<br>
 [15] Truth is lacking,<br>
  and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.<br>

  The LORD saw it, and it displeased him<br>
  that there was no justice.<br>
 [16] He saw that there was no man,<br>
  and wondered that there was no one to intercede;<br>
 then his own arm brought him salvation,<br>
  and his righteousness upheld him.<br>
 [17] He put on righteousness as a breastplate,<br>
  and a helmet of salvation on his head;<br>
 he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,<br>
  and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak. (ESV)<br>
