I believe the following steps/questions can take away reason from underneath unbelievers’ feet. You can then watch their entire house collapse, and it will be a spectacular sight.

Q1. Do they believe reality is real rather than their existence is just a brain in a jar and they are living in a simulation?

If the answer is yes then go to Q3, otherwise Q2.

Q2. If they believe their entire reality is potentially fake and just a simulation created by some evil scientist, then how could they believe any argument they construct in this fake reality to be true? Basically, any argument they make is using the language they learned in this fake reality, then surely no truth can be found if all is fake and all is simulated? They should have no claim to truth if that's what they believe. The end.

Q3. How do they know the reality they are perceiving is real rather than they are living in a simulation as described in the movie series The Matrix or they are just a brain in a jar (the philosophical thought experiment)?

The answer to Q3 is they can't know for certain and they have to believe the reality they are perceiving to be real based on faith and faith alone rather than reason.

They had faith all their lives without knowing and believed in the teaching of books that are not the best seller in mankind’s history. They had blind and complete trust all their lives, and yet they had the audacity to reject the teaching of mankind’s best seller claiming faith is irrational.

A bunch of fools and hypocrites.

Matthew 7:24-27

Build Your House on the Rock

[24] “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. [25] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. [26] And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [27] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”
