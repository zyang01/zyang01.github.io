Due to my actions that lack consideration and respect for my former employer, the two dozen mankind‚Äôs best-sellers that I dropped off last month were intercepted and prevented from distributing to the intended recipients. My sincere apologies for my impudence and lack of consideration for my former employer on my end.

I have spent some time reflecting on my thoughts and actions and put minimal effort into studying the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018. I have got the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO) on my speed dial.

Acts 5:27-29

[27] And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, [28] saying, ‚ÄúWe strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man‚Äôs blood upon us.‚Äù [29] But Peter and the apostles answered, ‚ÄúWe must obey God rather than men.

Philippians 1:12-18

The Advance of the Gospel

[12] I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, [13] so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. [14] And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

[15] Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. [16] The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. [17] The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. [18] What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. 

Matthew 5:43-48

Love Your Enemies

[43] ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.‚Äô [44] But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, [45] so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. [46] For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? [47] And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? [48] You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

2 Timothy 2:8-10

[8] Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, [9] for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound! [10] Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
