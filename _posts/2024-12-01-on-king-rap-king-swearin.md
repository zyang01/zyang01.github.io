Feelin’ it listening to “Lighters” Song by Bad Meets Evil and Bruno Mars. Partial lyrics below.

By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up

I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up

If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,

Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em' skyward uh

Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king

This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,

Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me

I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music

There is or there ever will be, disagree?

Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up

Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses

Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick

Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit

Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite

You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks

I love it when I tell 'em shove it

Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered

'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing

Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz

Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it

Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head

Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?

Or was it, 'cause them bitches wrote him off

Little hussy ass buzzards, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make?

What it take to get it through your thick skulls

As if this ain't some bullshit

People don't usually come back this way

From a place that was dark as I was in

Just to get to this place

Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage

And let it be known from this day forward

I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength

So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with five nine

But I feel like I'm six eight

We are fucking coming for you, you fucking ungrateful fucking pricks.

Edit: add more swear words for dramatic effect.
