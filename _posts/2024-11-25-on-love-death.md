For about two weeks after I got [kicked out of the gay/bi naturist campsite rosebay](https://joeatrosebay.com/){:target="_blank"}, I couldn't bear staying at home alone and just wanted to be around people, but at the same time, I also didn't want to talk to anyone because my brain was spinning at 1,000% capacity trying to figure out what went wrong at the campsite. There is a 24-hour gay sauna in Soho, London and I spent a lot of time there.

I was standing on Oxford Street one day after figuring out why it hurt that much to get kicked out. I realised it was because I loved them. I loved the couple who owned the campsite, and I saw John as my adopted father. I loved my neighbours at the campsite. And I absolutely freaking loved the campsite, that's why I bought a brand new caravan, moved in within two weeks, and gave them free wifi in the first place.

I learned a great deal of new skills in those three months, including but not limited to camping, caravaning, electrics, drilling, and 3D printing. I had two 3D printers delivered to the campsite and was printing PLA-CF Starlink supports.

I was standing on Oxford Street that evening, looking at the strangers walking by, and I realised I loved this world and everything that was in it after picking a fight with nature for three months. I asked myself how much I love this world, and using the equation of love as discussed in my previous post titled ‚Äú[On the Equation of Love](../on-equation-love/){:target="_blank"}‚Äù, I realised for a very brief moment that I was willing to take a bullet for any stranger that was walking past me. I think I felt His love for the first time at that exact moment.

Although, love does require a great deal of courage sometimes. If you were to ask me to go downstairs right now and take a bullet for a random stranger, I would tell you to piss off. ü•π

Romans 8:38-39

[38] For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, [39] nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

1 John 4:7-12

God Is Love

[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

John 15:13

[13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.
