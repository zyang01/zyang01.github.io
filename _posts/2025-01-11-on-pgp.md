In the usual holiday fashion, I spent most of my time in bed today. I watched a [YouTube discussion between Dr. Jordan Peterson and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel](https://youtu.be/4OcaMRLTyGI?t=3108&si=W2Qd411XSNCyMpcP){:target="_blank"} concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As mentioned in my previous psychology-related posts, I [learned quite a lot about modern psychology from Dr. Jordan Peterson](../graduating-therapy/){:target="_blank"}, and he's quite good at presenting arguments from a biblical perspective in his lectures. Before this faith journey, my understanding of Israel and the conflicts in the region was limited to several crash course history videos I watched on YouTube when I stumbled across the Six-Day War. Other than that, I know their tech industry is quite well developed and Nvidia has quite a substantial research and development effort in Tel-Aviv.

You may have noticed most of the scripture I quoted in my posts is from the New Testament. As a 110-day-old Christ bro, I find the teachings in the New Testament exceptionally helpful for day-to-day troubles and developed the project Bible Says Love ([BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"}) to help me live a Bible-guided life since the scribes and Pharisees either stopped replying to my emails and messages or avoid eye contact with me in church. Before this week, I had only [read the Book of Jonah](../reasoning-behind-preaching-mainland-china-jonah-style/){:target="_blank"} and [bits and pieces in the Old Testament](../on-genesis-3-fall-man/){:target="_blank"} when the sermons covered them. As mentioned in my posts this week, I had another scare when [I read about the suffering servant in Isaiah 53](../on-suffering-servant/){:target="_blank"}. I went down the rabbit hole and read bits and pieces in books by other prophets in the Old Testament with a heavy focus on the Book of Daniel, the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Jeremiah.

The Sunday morning 110 days ago, [I read the Book of Romans](../../about/){:target="_blank"} (New Testament) chapters 1 to 4 for the first time before going to my first church service. I considered the Bible to be telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth because [I felt the truth in my soul](../on-my-conversion-homosexuality/){:target="_blank"} and like I was reading a personal letter addressed to me. Last night, when I was watching Netanyahu boasting about the Abraham Accords and the economic cooperation brought about by gaining favours with kings in the region and more importantly a certain global superpower, I felt that truth again from my sparse reading of the Old Testament. Some quick further research suggests Netanyahu, the region's kings, the incoming golden calf and the golden calf's son-in-law Jared Kushner are all in bed together [worshipping a false idol called money](../on-two-masters-god-money/){:target="_blank"}. It appears rather ironic to an outsider like me that Israel considers its right to the land as God-given, and yet it's also doing exactly what God told them not to do. What made matters even worse is God also told them they would be rebellious and do what He told them not to do.

I spent around an hour of research into Judaism and Islam earlier this week and found out that the Old Testament is at least partially recognised by all three Abrahamic religions. I just found out that Jonah is the only one of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Hebrew Bible to be named in the Quran as I was doing real-time googling to confirm the accuracy of my statements. I have a weird feeling that the Old Testament alone contains enough prophecies and clues to demonstrate there is only one true God, the God of our fathers, the God of Abraham. Somehow, I think the most suitable emoji for that Day would be ðŸ¤¡.

Just two nights ago, I told Him I give up and please take my life away after realising a friendship was worth not more than a cup of coffee. If you read my posts, you should know [how much I'm willing to give](../on-sacrifice/){:target="_blank"} should a friend is ever in need. I couldn't quite remember a time that I needed anyone's serious help before the events of the last 15 months. I was [doing pretty well](../on-overemployment/){:target="_blank"} myself making half a million as a digital nomad working remotely and taking on the role of a single parent for two younger siblings. For the last 6 months, I did nothing but ask and [every mofo in my life turned their back on me](../on-anger-faith/){:target="_blank"}. Only He came.

Looking back, I wonder what did I get wrong to deserve all that. Looking forward, I wonder what did I get right to deserve someone like Him.

I did consider studying for a theology degree including potentially going back to Oxford when I went bothering the chaplain of Regent's Park College, Oxford. After the explicit and implicit rejections I received on this 4-month journey, I realised I shouldn't waste time on that. I have [more than one copy](../on-bible-bashing-continued/){:target="_blank"} of the textbook and my teacher is the Author.

Last but not least, I put on my crypto bro tin foil hat and generated a PGP key properly for the first time, in anticipation of the exciting journey ahead. My blog HeSaid.Love is a statically generated site with Jekyll and you can find the repo on my GitHub zyang01/zyang01.github.io in case you wanna keep an eye on the commit hashes. Cloudflare Workers & Pages automatically build the site when I git push. Just so you know, I suspect Cloudflare to be a black op since they serve a lot of traffic by offering free SSL, but unless you go through the trouble of setting up a custom certificate, they can inspect the traffic in plaintext.

I archived the blog and you can download the signed zip file via the link below or on IPFS. Future posts will all be signed through the git commits. I'm well rested after my holiday and it's time to learn some history and geopolitics and read the first half of the textbook.
