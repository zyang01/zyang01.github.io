Anyone and everyone*. It doesn't matter if you are a murderer, a rapist or an atheist. All we need to do is repent by sincere recognition of wrongdoings and trust in Him.

Ephesians 2:8

[8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,

1 John 1:9

[9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

Romans 5:8

[8] but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

*the only exception is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, but tbf I have no idea what it is. Consult a local theologian if you want to know more. 🤷

Matthew 12:31-32

[31] Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. [32] And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
