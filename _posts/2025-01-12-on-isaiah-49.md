I just sent an email to a dozen organisations including the Israeli embassy.

If people didn't backstab me to death in the last 15 months and the mofos in my life didn't turn their backs on me, I would be the last person on earth to be interested.

If it's up to me, I will light it up without hesitation, but it's [already on fire](https://biblesays.love/letter){:target="_blank"} so I wouldn't bother.

I sent the email to offer my assistance and feel free to ignore it like people do nowadays.

I only want to get done with this shit and go home.

It was my first proper distraction-free [holiday](https://real-life-fantasy.com/){:target="_blank"} ever at the campsite last year.
