If you look up the [symptoms of drug addiction or substance abuse](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16652-drug-addiction-substance-use-disorder-sud){:target="_blank"} online and replace the drug names with money, my guess is you would probably find it amusingly fitting.

I asked a friend of mine if he [fears God](../on-fearing-god){:target="_blank"}, and if not then could he tell me why. He said because he's only focused on making money.

Sounds like a drug addict to me. ðŸ¤”

Proverbs 17:16

[16]

Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom

when he has no sense?

Ecclesiastes 5:10

[10] He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.

Matthew 6:24

[24] â€œNo one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
