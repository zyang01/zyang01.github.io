A friend suggested I’m mentally ill again today without reading through all my posts. Dude, I have literally one ask in my profile, read all my fucking posts before opening your mouth or giving me advice. Also, I need an actual help hand, not another fucking advice. Talk is cheap folks, talk is cheap.

If you don’t believe I’m mentally well, watch the video in my previous post “On My Testimony”. Do I look fucking mentally ill to you??? 🤷🤷🤷

Also, my therapist did a TED talk on men’s mental health and he’s fine with my mental health. So shut your fucking mouth if you wanna tell me I’m mentally ill again.

Since I graduated from Cognitive fucking Behavioural Therapy, I’m gonna give an amateur psychological diagnosis.

Patient: mankind

Diagnosis: lack of faith

Cause of illness: disbelief

Symptom: cognitive dissonance, lawlessness and all kinds of evil

Treatment: have faith and read mankind’s best-seller

If you realise you are ill, I know a qualified mental health professional who did a TED talk on men’s mental health, and he's got an entire team ready to help. Alternatively, go to a nearby church this weekend and speak to a pastor.

As always, best wishes and good luck on judgement day. 🙏🫶😘
