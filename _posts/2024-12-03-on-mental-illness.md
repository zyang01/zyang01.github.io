A friend suggested I’m mentally ill again today without reading through all my posts. Dude, I have literally one ask in my profile, read all my fucking posts before opening your mouth or giving me advice. Also, I need an actual help hand, not another fucking advice. Talk is cheap folks, talk is cheap.

If you don’t believe I’m mentally well, watch the video in my previous post “[On My Testimony](../on-my-testimony/){:target="_blank"}”. Do I look fucking mentally ill to you??? 🤷🤷🤷

Also, my therapist did a TED talk on men’s mental health and he’s fine with my mental health. So shut your fucking mouth if you wanna tell me I’m mentally ill again.

Since I [graduated from Cognitive fucking Behavioural Therapy](../graduating-therapy/){:target="_blank"}, I’m gonna give an amateur psychological diagnosis.

Patient: mankind

Diagnosis: lack of faith

Cause of illness: disbelief

Symptom: [cognitive dissonance](../on-cognitive-dissonance/){:target="_blank"}, lawlessness and all kinds of evil

Treatment: have faith and read mankind’s best-seller

If you realise you are ill, I know a qualified mental health professional who did a TED talk on men’s mental health, and he's got an entire team ready to help. Alternatively, go to a nearby church this weekend and speak to a pastor.

As always, best wishes and good luck on judgement day. 🙏🫶😘
