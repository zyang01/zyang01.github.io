I was looking for my KCL student ID this morning hoping to visit Dr Modest next week and see if we could have a modest discussion regarding the simulation hypothesis because epistemologically it’s not possible for humans to tell whether we are living in a simulation.

I didn't find my KCL student ID, but I did find a bunch of red packets (hongbao) in just about half an hour totalling around 3,000 CNY (320 GBP/410 USD). I was an extremely insecure guy for the first 27 years of my life and every time I received a red packet I would leave it in a suitcase or a backpack in case of a rainy day. I also did a rough estimate of the total value of my possessions and I figure I could fetch around £20,000 if I sell them all. So all that kicking, screaming and shouting over the last couple of weeks were a bit unnecessary. Oops… No wonder the Lord didn't send help, He didn't need to. 🙄😳🤡

Time for a fire sale then. Let me know if you want a Solvo SV08 or a Rat Rig V-Core 4 3D printer, both top spec and brand new in original unopened packaging. Will give you a handsome discount, cash and collection only in London.

Also changed my name via deed poll yesterday. Will keep all the kicking, screaming and shouting posts, since they are the naked truth and an important part of Jonah Troublemaker Yang’s real-life fantasy.

It’s raining outside.

Matthew 19:16-21

The Rich Young Man

[16] And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” [17] And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” [18] He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, [19] Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [20] The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?” [21] Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”
