In case anyone is concerned, I know I still need to get a job and sort my mess out. My prayers and the Lord will help me, but that doesn’t mean I’m completely gone from earthly affairs. I know at the very least He won’t do my laundry for me. 🫠🙄🥲

I won’t be that guy is what I’m trying to say.

Best wishes as always. 🙏🫶😘
