Great Depression: 25% and severe deflation

The collapse of the Weimar Republic: 24% and hyperinflation

Spanish Civil War Aftermath: 20-30% and hyperinflation

Greece during the Eurozone Crisis: 27% and mild deflation

Zimbabwe 2008-2009: 80-90% and hyperinflation

I had a chat with a fellow computer scientist from Imperial College London. He leans towards the top 1% doing the work the bottom 99% are doing now.

My personal opinion is once we get to 10%/90%, it’s just a matter of time before 1%/99%.

I sincerely hope I'm wrong, but I believe we are walking off a cliff and this is the endgame.

Good luck, best wishes and God bless. 🙏

Revelation 6:6

[6] And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!” (ESV)

[Interpretation from BibleRef](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/6/Revelation-6-6.html){:target="_blank"}:

A denarius in the first century was usually equal to a day's wages, and the amount of grain given here is just enough to keep a person alive. These are also the commodities of the common person: basic staples for living. The implication seems to be that most people in this part of the tribulation are struggling just to meet their basic survival needs. This is the kind of poverty which threatens a person's life, not merely their lifestyle.

However, the voice from the midst of the four living creatures also commanded, "Do not harm the oil and wine!" Oil and wine, in this context, are less crucial supplies, making them a form of minor luxury. The implication that these are not harmed might suggest that wealthy people would not be hurt by the economic or inflationary catastrophe. According to Revelation 13:16–17, the false prophet in Jerusalem will control commerce during the tribulation, making it extremely difficult for tribulation believers to purchase even basic commodities.

Edit: add Revelation 6:6 and the interpretation from BibleRef.
