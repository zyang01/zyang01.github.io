Just in case my comment gets deleted.

No meme needed this time.

Proverbs 18:2

[2]

A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,

but only in expressing his opinion.

Edit: I wonder if the queue at A&E is long today. 🤔

Update: the chef blocked me on LinkedIn. Can't remember if the employee health insurance at Trilitech covers stupidity. Don’t eat yellow cake folks, it's radioactive and toxic. 🙏🫶😘
