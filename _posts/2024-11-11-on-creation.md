Did we create anything at all? Of course you can make the claim that we created structures and patterns metaphysically speaking. But did we create a single atom?

I spoke with a friend who recently completed his PhD in Physics at Oxford. My understanding on the situation is particle physics is basically dead, but the people behind projects such as the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland are reluctant to admit that given how much money has already been spent and the amount of PR that already went out. I think that’s also intellectual pride? 🤔

I believe the consensus on the matter (bad pun intended) is, if you want to go to the next energy level that even remotely has the hope of smashing into something of significance would require a particle accelerator to be built in space because it won’t fit on earth. Good luck with that I guess? 🤷

I think the best we could say is we laboured. I’m not sure we can make the claim that we created.
