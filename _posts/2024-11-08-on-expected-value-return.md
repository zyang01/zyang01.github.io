If you’re not a crypto/finance/tech/maths bro, or it’s been a while since your last lecture on probability 101, here’s some prerequisite reading on expected value/return.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value

Let’s assume your mind is not yet so blinded by the god of this world (money or whatever), and the probability of what I’m saying turns out to be true is some astronomically small number, say 1 over 1^36 for the sake of argument and let’s denote this number as P. So P is one in a billion billion billion billion.

Let’s denote whatever total reward you receive for your remaining time on this earth to be R, and burning in hell for eternity to be B.

Then I believe your expected return as an unbeliever is

E(X) = R * (1 - P) + B * P

Dunno about you, but I think that’s a negative number. 🤷

I plan on being a Christian for the next 7 years at least, just in case He comes back. Kinda loving it right now and might be in it for the long haul. Let’s see.

Good luck and best wishes as always. 😘🫶🙏
