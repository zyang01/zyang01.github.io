A former colleague asked me if the experiences and posts in my LinkedIn profile are true. I told him it’s 1,000% true, but he did help me spot the error I made and the company that I got fired from after submitting 1 PR was BoomFi rather than BlockFi. Thanks mate. 🙏 

If you think about it, I have essentially publically crucified and executed myself for the first 27 years of my life. I’m not ashamed of my actions and boasting in the name of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It’s a lose only trade and I’m not doing this to seek any monetary gains, but you are still free to buy me a coffee if you wish to do so and absolutely no pressure. 😉

Another former colleague also advised me to cleanup my LinkedIn profile. I believe we are taught to be salt of the earth and light of the world in scripture. I think I’m going to stick to being an extra potent salt and I don’t care how many times I get stabbed by words from unbelievers, I’m gonna light myself up and expose the darkness of this godless world.

Someone’s got to make a stand at some point. We can’t keep falling like this.

Matthew 5:13-16

Salt and Light

[13] “You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people’s feet.

[14] “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. [15] Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. [16] In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
