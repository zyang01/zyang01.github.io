I'm not too bothered with writing too much on this topic since I have more or less covered them previously in bits and pieces. Will make some bullet points and you can see below what ChatGPT thinks.

- Business schools everywhere
- Existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism
- Drug addicts who don't know what to believe, aren't even sure if reality is simulated, and are only interested in more drugs
- Theology is compared to the study of unicorns and fairytales
- Intellectual pride hiding behind jargon and publications

I'm using the ChatGPT free plan and rarely get limited. The next level up is $20 a month. I'm pretty sure I can train an open-source model in a couple of days. I'm not massively sure why I paid Â£100k (overseas which is 3x local) for my Oxford CS degree.
