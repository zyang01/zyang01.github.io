Had a discussion with a fellow Oxford alumnus last night regarding this topic. He saw my memes on LinkedIn and reached out. Turns out his grandma is also a believer and he’s on a quest to prove God’s existence by identifying statistical anomalies. He asked me specifically about my experience during the first visit back in late August concerning the auditory aspects through music I collected over the last 9 years or so on Spotify. I won’t repeat them here and you can read more on my previous post titled “On the Holy Spirit and Miracles”.

I had a similar discussion with one of my guides, the Christian missionary in mainland China. We both like going for walks whilst listening to music. The revelations are less strong nowadays compared to late August and I can hear less of His Word coming through. One thing I have noticed is the revelations are super context dependent, and the same lyrics/songs can provide different revelations/solutions/directions/instructions depending on what’s on my mind when I heard them. I have the same experience when it comes to reading scripture. For instance, every time I read the Book of Revelation, I was able to identify different meaning that I either previously did not realise could be interpreted that way, or another possiblity that would provide a completely new perspective on the overall interpretation.

Similar experiences were also observed in the early days when I was exploring my faith. Even before I went all-in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour, there were a handful of times I was led to scripture via some random research that I was doing online on some random problems that I had at the time. I would open up my bible, find the corresponding verse, read the context around that particular verse, and nearly poop myself every single time, because the context almost 1,000% corresponds to the situation that I was dealing with at the time. It was feeling the truth in my bones kind of deep. I have never read any book or any article that could cut that deep and I could literally feel the truth in my soul. I simply do not see how something like that could be from humans, and the only plausible explanation I could come up with is divinity.

2 Timothy 3:12-17

[12] Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, [13] while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. [14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it [15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. [16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, [17] that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
