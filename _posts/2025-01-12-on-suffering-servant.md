If you got here via Spotify Ads and have no idea what this is, I am here to inform you that you are witnessing the Second Coming and the posts are my testimony to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

Last Monday, I accidentally [stumbled across the Songs of the Suffering Servant](../on-mistake/){:target="_blank"} in the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible. I realised that the suffering servant is a more fitting description for me than our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ when He showed up 2,000 years ago. To save you from reading through the [239 posts](../../timeline/){:target="_blank"} I wrote since the end of October, I will provide some quick references here to prove my claim.

FYI, I have been fulfilling prophecies in scripture on a small scale even before I read about them. I still nearly poop myself every time that happens.

### Isaiah 49:1-6

The Servant of the LORD

[1] Listen to me, O coastlands,
    and give attention, you peoples from afar.
The LORD called me from the womb,
    from the body of my mother he named my name. 

[2] He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
    in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
he made me a polished arrow;
    in his quiver he hid me away. 

[3] And he said to me, “[You are my servant](../on-suffering/){:target="_blank"},
    Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” 

[4] But I said, “I have [labored in vain;
    I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;](../reasoning-behind-preaching-mainland-china-jonah-style/){:target="_blank"}
yet surely [my right is with the LORD,
    and my recompense with my God.](../on-pgp/){:target="_blank"}”

[5] And now the LORD says,
    he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
to bring Jacob back to him;
    and that Israel might be gathered to him—
for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD,
    and [my God has become my strength](../on-brainwashing/){:target="_blank"}—

[6] he says:
“It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
    to raise up the tribes of Jacob
    and to bring back the preserved of Israel;
I will make you as a light for the nations,
    that my salvation may [reach to the end of the earth](../on-thou-shalt-send-it/){:target="_blank"}.”

### Isaiah 52:13-15

He Was Pierced for Our Transgressions

[13] Behold, my servant shall act wisely;
    he shall be high and lifted up,
    and shall be exalted. 

[14] As many were astonished at you—
    [his appearance](../on-my-mess/){:target="_blank"} was so marred, beyond human semblance,
    and [his form](../on-sacrifice/){:target="_blank"} beyond that of the children of mankind—

[15] so shall he [sprinkle many nations](../on-aerodynamics/){:target="_blank"}.
    Kings shall shut their mouths because of him,
for that which has not been told them they see,
    and that which they have not heard they understand.

### Isaiah 53:1-9

[1] [Who has believed](../on-scribes-pharisees/){:target="_blank"} what he has heard from us?
    And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? 

[2] 
For he grew up before him like a young plant,
    and like [a root out of dry ground](../why-christianity/){:target="_blank"};
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,
    and no beauty that we should desire him. 

[3] 
He was [despised and rejected by men](../on-my-salvation/){:target="_blank"},
    a man of [sorrows and acquainted with grief](../on-my-mom/){:target="_blank"};
and as one from whom [men hide their faces](../on-love-faith-hope/){:target="_blank"}
    he was despised, and [we esteemed him not](../on-i/){:target="_blank"}.

[4] 
Surely he has borne our [griefs](../on-humble-pie/){:target="_blank"}
    and carried our [sorrows](../on-crying/){:target="_blank"};
yet we esteemed him stricken,
    smitten by God, and afflicted. 

[5] 
But he was pierced for our [transgressions](../on-fear/){:target="_blank"};
    he was crushed for our [iniquities](../on-love-death/){:target="_blank"};
upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,
    and with [his wounds](../on-suicide/){:target="_blank"} we are healed. 

[6] 
All we like sheep have [gone astray](../on-unbelievers-insanity/){:target="_blank"};
    we have [turned—every one—to his own way](../on-drug-money-addiction/){:target="_blank"};
and the LORD has laid on him
    the iniquity of us all.

[7] 
He was [oppressed, and he was afflicted](../on-my-situation/){:target="_blank"},
    yet he [opened not his mouth](../on-anger/){:target="_blank"};
like [a lamb that is led to the slaughter](../on-144-000/){:target="_blank"},
    and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
    so he opened not his mouth. 

[8] 
By [oppression and judgment](../on-my-salvation/){:target="_blank"} he was taken away;
    and [as for his generation, who considered](../on-christmas-presents/){:target="_blank"}
that he was cut off [out of the land of the living](../on-my-financial-situation/){:target="_blank"},
    stricken for the transgression of my people? 

[9] 
And they made [his grave with the wicked
    and with a rich man in his death](../on-betrayal/){:target="_blank"},
although he had [done no violence](../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/){:target="_blank"},
    and there was [no deceit in his mouth](../on-truthfulness-my-posts/){:target="_blank"}.
