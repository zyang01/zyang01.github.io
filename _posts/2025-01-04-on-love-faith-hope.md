If I were to summarise the biggest lesson I learned last year, then that would be the relationship between love, faith and hope.

My subjective observation so far is that people without faith are generally loveless and hopeless.

Loveless in that they wouldn't even spare a cup of coffee when I'm at the lowest point of my life and in desperate need of a little help. This was made worse by the fact that I had been faithful to them in our relationships up to the point I asked for help. I simply could not comprehend why they could just turn their backs as though they did not know me.

Hopeless in that faithlessness essentially led to the [illness of nihilism](../on-nihilism/){:target="_blank"}. If you are unaware you are ill then you should read more books. Everyone simply blames the coldness of this world on that's how things are and [becomes indifferent to the suffering of others](../on-indifference/){:target="_blank"}. Since everyone will die at the end, why not enjoy it as much as I can and fuck others right?

As mentioned in my previous post titled “[On the Equation of Love](../on-equation-love){:target="_blank"}”, I came up with an equation to quantify love when I was 16. It's the greatest amount of sacrifice one is willing to make. If you ask any father how much they are willing to sacrifice for their child, my guess is they would give up their own life at any time without hesitation.

If you read my posts and believe I did do the things I did last year, then you should know how much I love you. If you still don't believe it, then I prepared a New Year present for the world to accompany my Christmas presents.

Tomorrow morning will mark my full 15 weeks as a Christian. The last 15 weeks were quite a roller coaster ride even for me. I wanted to either give up or burn the world down every other day, but He always managed to pick up me, fix me and cheer me up at the end of the day. I thought there might be a non-zero probability that I might have to burn the world down one day, but I realised I wouldn’t need to do that because it's already on fire. It's just most people are either sleepwalking or pretending to sleepwalk.

I think the time is seriously near this time. And if you received my New Year present to the world and wonder why. It’s because of love, and to be honest I enjoyed preparing the present. I realised He made me who I am exactly for that reason, I just needed to realise I should seek to please Him rather than men. Although, I think this present might have managed to please all three relevant parties. 🤔

Since the scribes and Pharisees either stopped replying to my emails or avoided eye contact with me, I figured they had enough light already and decided to put my light in places that needed it the most. Unlike the scribes and Pharisees, I go full range.

Matthew 23:12

[12] Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
