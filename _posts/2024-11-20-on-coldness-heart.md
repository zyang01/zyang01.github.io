Over the last eight and a half weeks as a believer, I had this irresistible urge to shove mankind’s best seller to everyone I know, including friends, family and old colleagues.

I admit my methods could be somewhat unconventional and at times lack consideration for the receipient. I sincerely apologise to everyone if I caused any transgression or offence in the process. Personally, I did it because I cared and it is my firm belief that I should at the very least try to save as many people as possible.

Some of my efforts have so far seem futile and the process is also rather draining for me personally. It felt like no matter how hard I try, I simply could not get through to people’s hearts and I kept knocking on their hearts of stone until my hands were bleeding.

I shoved everyone a mankind’s best seller that they could hug to sleep, and yet they wouldn’t even buy me a coffee for old times’ sake. I feel kinda hurt tbh.

Ezekiel 36:25-28

[25] I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. [26] And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. [27] And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. [28] You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
