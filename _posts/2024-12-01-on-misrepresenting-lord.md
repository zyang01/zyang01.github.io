Not sure if anyone’s noticed, but I have only ever described my relationship with my Heavenly Father and our conversations. I believe everyone’s relationship with Him is deeply personal.

I should never proclaim He said you or anyone should do this or do that. I don't think we should believe anyone who does that. And everything I describe between Him and I is my personal and human interpretation, which is subject to human frailty and mistakes. Always seek confirmation through scripture and the personal direct line of communication with the Boss Man.

Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,

Romans 10:9-10

2 Corinthians 5:10

[10] For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

Psalm 34:18

[18] The LORD is near to the brokenhearted

and saves the crushed in spirit.

Romans 8:15-16

[15] For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” [16] The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
