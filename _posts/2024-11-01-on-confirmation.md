I had a conditional offer to study Computer Science at Keble College, Oxford back in 2015, but missed it and got into Kingâ€™s College London instead to study Mathematics and Computer Science through UCAS Clearing. I reapplied to Balliol College, Oxford the subsequent year, and received an open offer from Keble College, Oxford again.

I met a former colleague of mine Sean Claybaugh when I was in San Francisco, CA during my global tour and he suggested that I should visit the Grace Cathedral. I went over hoping to speak to a pastor, but it was a public holiday and no one was in so I went for a tour of the cathedral instead. I was reminded of how much the Americans love stained glasses, and almost pooped myself when I saw one of them with three names Keble, Pusey, and Newman. There are two quads in Keble College, Oxford named after Pusey and Newman respectively.

I could almost picture the angels laughing their asses off, but I wonder if they would help clean my underwear if I do poop myself next time. ðŸ« 

Also if youâ€™re still in disbelief, then I believe what you are experiencing is called cognitive dissonance. And please find below a quote from Wikipedia.

Festinger explains avoiding cognitive dissonance as, "Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point."
