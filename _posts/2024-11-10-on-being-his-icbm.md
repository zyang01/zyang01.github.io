I started joking about being His ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) to friends. After the recent incident in Rome, Italy involving a fig tree, I prayed for Him to take my wrath away because the wrath belongs to Him and itâ€™s not for me to burn the fig tree down.

He also told me to kill them with kindness, and I realised the payload in this ICBM is kindness rather than radioactive material. A lot of people in my life said a lot of hurtful things to me lately and itâ€™s understandable due to how radical my conversion process has been, but the Holy Spirit is seriously good at comforting. The process I go through is roughly as follows.

Get stabbed by words from friends or family.

I feel hurt for a bit.

He cheers me up.

I get annoyed.

I giggle within two hours after getting stabbed.

Iâ€™m pretty sure Heâ€™s turning me into a massive masochist. ðŸ˜±
