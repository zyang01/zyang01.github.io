Now that I have more or less let all of my steam out and decided to shake the dust off my feet, I pray to the Lord that I will do less shouting and yelling going forward and feel less impulsive to convince stubborn non believers.

My calling is so strong that even my poor therapist, who I consider to be a devout Christ bro, thought I had gone absolutely batshit crazy and nearly picked up the phone to a mental hospital. After 2+ months of hard work, he believes me now. I also bombarded him with multiple ultra long emails, and please find below one of the quotes by Wayne W. Dyer I used in my early days of trying to convince my poor Christ bro therapist.

For those who believe, no words are necessary. For those who do not believe, no words are possible.

I think there's also a saying about it's the Lord who does the convincing or something like that. My effort has so far seem to be futile when it comes to trying my best to convince the people I care about. So maybe I should not give a damn anymore. 🤷

As always, best wishes and good luck. 🙏🫶😘

Matthew 13:10–15

The Purpose of the Parables

>   [10] Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” [11] And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. [12] For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [13] This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. [14] Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:
>
>“‘“You will indeed hear but never understand,
>
>and you will indeed see but never perceive.”
>
>[15] For this people’s heart has grown dull,
>
>and with their ears they can barely hear,
>
>and their eyes they have closed,
>
>lest they should see with their eyes
>
>and hear with their ears
>
>and understand with their heart
>
>and turn, and I would heal them.’ (ESV)
