He told me to prepare for war when He visited me for the first time back in late August. He told me that one day we will assemble in darkness, and there will be many of them and few of us, but it will be okay. I later worked out that it’s a war against the root of all evil - the love of money, after seeing the evil people are willing to do.

He also said He will show me what I want to see, take me where I want to go, and give me something I have absolutely no interest in.

There’s no need to believe anything that I post here since I’m just another religious nut job, and feel free to dismiss it all. On the day of harvest, we will pay you a visit, and offer you a carrot first before any kneecaps get busted. 😘🫶🙏

Remember, Jesus won.
