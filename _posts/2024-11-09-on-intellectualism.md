I tried to rewatch the four horsemen of new atheism videos on YouTube after my conversion. I used to agree with their scientific materialistic view on the world, but I had to pause the video every five minutes this time around, because I wanted to slap them in the face so that they would wake the hell up. I ended up slapping myself a couple of times and couldn't bear watching their ego and pride after about half an hour into the discussion.

The head horseman Richard Dawkins said earlier this year that he considers himself a cultural Christian now.

The day after my arrival in San Francisco, I walked into a CVS near Pier 39 and they had toilet paper locked up behind glass panels on shelfs. I jumped into a Waymo self-driving taxi to escape a street full of homeless people and some were doing drugs under broad daylight. There was a Tesla dealership right across the road with a Cybertruck on display. Can you seriously in good conscience tell me that the end times are not here yet?

1 Corinthians 1:26–31

[26] For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. [27] But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; [28] God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, [29] so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. [30] And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, [31] so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.” (ESV)
