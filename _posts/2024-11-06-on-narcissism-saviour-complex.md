I couldn’t think of a better way to summarise narcissism than being accused of pride when all that I want is to offer salvation to their soul. I believe I’m saved already through faith, and I could’ve just sat around watching Netflix waiting for Him to come back. I don’t get paid doing this. 🤷

I believe there was a legend in history who probably has a gigantic saviour complex. I’m gonna run after Him, are you coming with us? Also, I think more people should develop a bit of saviour complex nowadays, don’t you think? 🤔
