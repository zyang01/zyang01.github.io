I couldnâ€™t think of a better way to summarise narcissism than being accused of pride when all that I want is to offer salvation to their soul. I believe Iâ€™m saved already through faith, and I couldâ€™ve just sat around watching Netflix waiting for Him to come back. I donâ€™t get paid doing this. ðŸ¤·

I believe there was a legend in history who probably has a gigantic saviour complex. Iâ€™m gonna run after Him, are you coming with us? Also, I think more people should develop a bit of saviour complex nowadays, donâ€™t you think? ðŸ¤”
