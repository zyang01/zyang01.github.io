When was the last time you humbled yourself and sincerely admitted your wrongdoing? I did that this morning after realising my hypocrisy and confessed it to my Father and the world.

Suppose for the sake of argument God does exist, how would you approach Him? Is it with reverence or with disrespect and contempt thinking the creator of the universe that you are currently living in and who gave you all the nice things that you are currently enjoying is someone you could bargain and argue with?

Since unbelievers like reason so much, perhaps it's wise to contemplate the following comment from a friend of mine with your reasoning skills when you have the time.

Perhaps it's mankindâ€™s best seller for a reason.

Just a kind reminder again. 5 billion printed copies, while the second best seller printed 1 billion copies.

Unbelievers keep asking and wanting to see evidence. What more do you want to see? Which book of fairytales and made-up stories endured the test of time for thousands of years?

Q.E.D.

Matthew 24:35

[35] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
