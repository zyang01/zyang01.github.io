As alluded to in the launch post of project Bible Says Love ([BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love){:target="_blank"}) titled “[On Cheating and Bible Says Love](../on-cheating-bible-says-love){:target="_blank"}”, the project currently relays the incoming requests to OpenAI’s GPT-4o model for processing and returns the response to the user.

The ultimate goal for the project is an app that can be run on any modern mobile device without an internet connection using an open-source lightweight large language model. This is because I'm personally highly sceptical of OpenAI’s ethical practices after the [saga in November 2023](https://mashable.com/article/openai-sam-altman-saga-timeline){:target="_blank"}. Their CEO Sam Altman is also a candidate on [my list of potential Antichrists](../on-possible-antichrists){:target="_blank"}.

I'm currently evaluating lightweight models which include [DistilBERT](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers){:target="_blank"} and [MobileBERT](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mobilebert){:target="_blank"}. Let me know if you're into LLMs and wanna help. 🙏

Btw, project [Bible Says Love](../on-cheating-bible-says-love){:target="_blank"} ([BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love){:target="_blank"}) now has multilingual support through Google Translate. Enjoy. 🙏🫶😘

Matthew 28:19-20

[19] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20] teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”
