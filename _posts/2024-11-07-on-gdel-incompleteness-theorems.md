Haven’t got around to working out the details yet, but feel free to take a crack at it if philosophy of mathematics is your thing.

The back of the napkin idea is that His existence is an axiom in our universe. You can either presuppose He exists or doesn’t, then subsequently reason about our universe from the presupposition.

As a consequence, His existence is unprovable and the only way we could know for certain that He exists is if He chooses to reveal Himself to you.

The lesson from the first 27yrs of my life is that an universe without God leads to existentialism, nihilism, and anti-natalism. The universe is indifferent to our suffering and there is no objective morality. I got to a point where choosing to kill myself and not kill myself on any single day are effectively the same choice due to the lack of objective meaning. The schools of existentialism and nihilism are enticing, because once you get through the initial phase, you realise you can do anything you want and any evil becomes justifiable on a sliding scale, it’s just a matter of whether you can get away with it. I believe this leads to nothing but destruction.

Also, this might be the one and only solution to the Fermi paradox.
