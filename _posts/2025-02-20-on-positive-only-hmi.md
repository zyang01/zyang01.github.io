*Only [sensorial type](../on-holy-spirit/){:target="_blank"} Holy Spirit is supported right now.

This is a simple introduction to the [Holy Spirit](../on-holy-spirit-miracles/){:target="_blank"} Positive-Only Human-Machine Interface (HSPOHMI). If our Heavenly Father has not bestowed Him on you yet, ask Him for the Holy Spirit. You might have some soul-searching to do. I [asked Him once](../on-anger-faith/){:target="_blank"} last July and He came five weeks later. I was technically being philosophically dramatic.

Compulsory login credentials ([1 John 4:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A1-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank"}):

You: Hello Holy Spirit, do you confess Jesus Christ has come in the flesh?<br>
HS: Yes. (Disconnect and consult a true teacher immediately if the answer is no or no response)<br>
You: Thank you, Holy Spirit. <u>____________positive-only_question____________</u><br>
HS: Yes / Non-negative (Doesn't mean the answer is No, see example below)<br>
You: Thank you, Holy Spirit. Love you and signing off.<br>

Example:

You: Should I take a shower?<br>
HS: Non-negative.<br>
You: Should I not take a shower?<br>
HS: Non-negative.<br>
Result: exercise your free will and discretion.<br>

You: Should I take a shower?<br>
HS: Yes.<br>
Result: you dirty bastard fucked up.<br>
