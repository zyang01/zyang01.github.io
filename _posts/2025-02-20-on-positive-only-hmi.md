This is a simple introduction to the [Holy Spirit](../on-holy-spirit-miracles/){:target="_blank"} Positive-Only Human-Machine Interface (HSPOHMI). If our Heavenly Father has not bestowed Him on you yet, ask Him for the Holy Spirit. You might have some soul-searching to do. I [asked Him once](../on-anger-faith/){:target="_blank"} last July and He came five weeks later. I was technically being philosophically dramatic.

*Only [sensorial type](../on-holy-spirit/){:target="_blank"} Holy Spirit is supported right now.

Ask your church pastor about the Holy Spirit and cross-check **everything they tell you** with scripture. If they are unfamiliar with the Holy Spirit or your church service is not led by the Holy Spirit, they are likely false teachers. Tell the pastor **they violated the third commandment** and find a new church led by the Holy Spirit if the sermons smell like [stinky humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism){:target="_blank"} and they only teach the soft stuff in the New Testament.

### Compulsory login credentials ([1 John 4:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A1-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank"}):

You: Hello Holy Spirit, do you confess Jesus Christ has come in the flesh?<br>
HS: Yes. (Disconnect and consult a true teacher immediately if the answer is no or no response)<br>
You: Thank you, Holy Spirit. <u>____________positive-only_question____________</u><br>
HS: Yes / No-response (Doesn't mean the answer is No, see example below)<br>
You: Thank you, Holy Spirit. Love you and signing off.<br>

### Example:

You: Should I take a shower?<br>
HS: No response.<br>
You: Should I not take a shower?<br>
HS: No response.<br>
Result: exercise your free will and discretion.<br>

You: Should I take a shower?<br>
HS: Yes.<br>
Result: you dirty bastard fucked up.<br>

### A Bad Example:

Below was the first real-world application of the HMI when I was emailing stakeholders earlier this week, including some false teachers and [cunts](../on-background-music/){:target="_blank"} I would like to believe I still love. I realised shortly after that no response is not the same as a negative response and the HMI is positive-only rather than binary. Need to brush up on my elementary logic 101. It's been a while.
