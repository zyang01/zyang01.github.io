I discussed with an antichrist pretending to be a Christian this morning. How do I know they are an antichrist? Because they speak as though they have never read one of the gospels, and nearly every opinion they express goes against Boss Man's teachings.

I watched a sermon on the abomination of desolation on YouTube a while back. The preacher mentioned that Boss Man hates idolatry the most, and the severity of His hatred against idolatry is like no other in the Old Testament.

Shortly before writing this post, it dawned on me what it truly means to worship false idols. I realized there is a form of idolatry that many people, including most Christians, antichrists included, might not even recognize. But before I unpack all that, let's revisit what Boss Man said about the commandments.

## Matthew 22:34–40

The Great Commandment

[34] But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. [35] And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. [36] “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” ***[37] And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”*** (ESV)

Did you notice the verb in both commandments is the same? Boss Man said to ***love***. I suspect unbelievers and possibly most Christians, especially the antichrists, do not know what the first commandment means. You need to know who God is and what He is like before you can understand the first commandment. John the Apostle answered that in 1 John.

## 1 John 4:7–12

God Is Love

***[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.*** [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. (ESV)

Assuming you did not fail your logical reasoning or reading comprehension in school, you should be able to logically deduce the following statement using the concept of [equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation){:target="_blank"}. You shall **love *love*** with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.

If you have followed the logical reasoning up to this point, it is natural to wonder, "What is love?" If you are the lucky target of my clickbait campaigns, you would know the equation of love I derived at age 16.

**Love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.**

The definition is confirmed by Boss Man's actions 2,000 years ago before He went on a 2,000-year paid leave due to a severe workplace injury, as well as His words.

## John 15:12–17

[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. ***[13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.*** [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)

Through the [lesson of Genesis 3](../on-genesis-3-fall-man/){:target="_blank"}, we learned the importance of the [order of precedence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations){:target="_blank"}. We can apply the same principle here and deduce the following statement. You are worshipping a false idol called **the law** if you believe God hates rampant homosexuals like me. **You are effectively putting the law above God by putting the law above love.**

## 1 Corinthians 13

The Way of Love

[1] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. [2] And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. [3] If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

[4] Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant [5] or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; [6] it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. [7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

[8] Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. [11] When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.

***[13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.*** (ESV)

Through this 26-week and 2-day faith journey, I learned the world does not know God and love. If you subscribe to the [religion of Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism){:target="_blank"}, you would not know God and love because you do not know what it means to sacrifice. All you would know is natural selection and survival of the fittest. Your existence and suffering are inherently meaningless due to [existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism){:target="_blank"}, [nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism){:target="_blank"} and [antinatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism){:target="_blank"}. There is nothing but death waiting for you at the end of the road. Congratulations, I guess.

I came across this [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA){:target="_blank"} called *TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A Journey to the End of Time (4K)* during COVID-19. I was obsessed with [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics){:target="_blank"} and the mysteries of our physical universe. It's an amazing production, but unfortunately, it's also a load of bull excrement. Now that I know the truth. Enjoy.
