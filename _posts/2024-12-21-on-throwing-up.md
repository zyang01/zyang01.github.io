I had a pretty big lunch yesterday and was travelling back home in the London underground when I had the confirmation for the economic scenario outlined in my previous posts titled “[On What I Think Will Happen](../on-what-i-think-will-happen){:target="_blank"}” and “[On Aerodynamics](../on-aerodynamics){:target="_blank"}”.

I almost had a panic attack and felt absolutely sick to my stomach thinking what would happen if a [90% or 99% unemployment rate](../on-unemployment-rates-inflation){:target="_blank"} occurred.

Once again, the Lord will take care of me and I'm not worried in the slightest for myself and my future. I don't get paid doing everything I'm doing right now. I'm doing it because I want to and out of my own volition.

If you don't believe me, then that's fine with me.

It's not like I have a [computer science degree from Oxford](https://veri.edocuments.ox.ac.uk/?reference=17105220-01-QRNW){:target="_blank"} and [spent nearly a decade building algorithmic trading models](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-troublemaker-yang/){:target="_blank"} or something.

Proverbs 12:15

[15]

The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,

but a wise man listens to advice.

Proverbs 1:7

[7] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge;

fools despise wisdom and instruction.

Proverbs 18:2

[2]

A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,

but only in expressing his opinion.
