Instead of running in front of my Boss and falling over every time, I’m trying to be more patient and learning to dance with Him in a pas de deux.

2 Samuel 6:12-15

[12] And it was told King David, “The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing. [13] And when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal. [14] And David danced before the LORD with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod. [15] So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn.

Psalm 149:1-5

Sing to the LORD a New Song

[1] Praise the LORD!

Sing to the LORD a new song,

his praise in the assembly of the godly! 

[2] Let Israel be glad in his Maker;

let the children of Zion rejoice in their King! 

[3] Let them praise his name with dancing,

making melody to him with tambourine and lyre! 

[4] For the LORD takes pleasure in his people;

he adorns the humble with salvation. 

[5] Let the godly exult in glory;

let them sing for joy on their beds.

Psalm 150

Let Everything Praise the LORD

[1] Praise the LORD!

Praise God in his sanctuary;

praise him in his mighty heavens! 

[2] Praise him for his mighty deeds;

praise him according to his excellent greatness!

[3] Praise him with trumpet sound;

praise him with lute and harp! 

[4] Praise him with tambourine and dance;

praise him with strings and pipe! 

[5] Praise him with sounding cymbals;

praise him with loud clashing cymbals! 

[6] Let everything that has breath praise the LORD!

Praise the LORD!
