I have forgiven everyone who I once thought betrayed me in the last 12 months or so, prayed for their salvation, and sent them bibles. I realised it’s not for me to judge since I have no claim to righteousness and I should forgive them just as Jesus forgave us.

The campsite boss John said after kicking me out that he wished that I would find my happiness. I believe he genuinely meant that, and I think I have found it. I prayed for the salvation of everyone at rosebay. 🙏🫶😘

For the former friend who mentally tortured me for six months for something they needed without regards to my personal wellbeing and I always delivered even when I had been up for over 24hrs straight catching deadlines and when my eye was bleeding, I also forgave them and wish them all the best. Unfortunately I have to leave them behind now, and I stayed till they kicked me out despite the fact that He told me to walk away weeks prior. I thought I was going to be heart broken the moment I made that decision since it’s a nearly decade long friendship, but then again the Holy Spirit is genuinely good at comforting and I felt a peace inside that I simply had no words to describe. As my brothers and sisters at the Seventh Day Baptist Church I go to on Saturdays like to say, praise the Lord. 🙏

Btw, Saturday is the correct day to observe Sabbath.

Edit: In fact, I think I should be grateful to both of them. Because I found God's love. 🙏
