Proverbs 3:5-6

[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,

and do not lean on your own understanding. 

[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,

and he will make straight your paths.

Proverbs 28:1

[1] The wicked flee when no one pursues,

but the righteous are bold as a lion.

Proverbs 24:15-18

[15] 

Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous;

do no violence to his home; 

[16] 

for the righteous falls seven times and rises again,

but the wicked stumble in times of calamity.

[17] 

Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,

and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles, 

[18] 

lest the LORD see it and be displeased,

and turn away his anger from him.

Proverbs 2:7-8

[7] he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;

he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, 

[8] guarding the paths of justice

and watching over the way of his saints.

Proverbs 14:16-18

[16] 

One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil,

but a fool is reckless and careless. 

[17] 

A man of quick temper acts foolishly,

and a man of evil devices is hated. 

[18] 

The simple inherit folly,

but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

Proverbs 31:8-9

[8] Open your mouth for the mute,

for the rights of all who are destitute. 

[9] Open your mouth, judge righteously,

defend the rights of the poor and needy.

Proverbs 29:25

[25] 

The fear of man lays a snare,

but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe.
