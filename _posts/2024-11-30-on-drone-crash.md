Around half an hour after my previous post, I was overjoyed with the idea of meeting Mr Noisy Gong one day and was trying some fancy drone manoeuvres downstairs, but ended up in a crash three days after purchase.

As a worry-free five-year-old, this would normally break my heart, but the Holy Spirit comforted me and I wasn't sad at all due to how the purchase unfolded three days ago, which I'm transcribing below.

*me rocking up to the DJI store in Piccadilly Circus planning to purchase the DJI MINI 4K Fly More Combo which costs £319 on the black Friday sale. The following conversation took place whilst I was waiting for a sales assistant and looking at the drone specs.

God: Go big or go home. DJI AIR 3S full package.

Me: Dude, I gotta eat! And only £1,900 left in the bank now (part of a £4,000 loan from a friend’s aunt) and it costs £1,400!!!

God: Go for it, make it rain.

Me: 🙄 Fine, as you wish my Lord. Hmm… should I get the 2-year insurance too. It's my first drone and all.

Holy Spirit: Yes.

Me: 🙄🙄🙄

So I ended up paying £89 for the replacement, which should be ready in 2 weeks. Should give me enough time to work on project Peanut Butter Jelly Part 2. 😬

My bank balance is below £50 again, but the Lord sent help yesterday via a refund from KCL for the £1,000 payment I made back in mid-August when KCL credit control was chasing me for £13,000 overdue tuition fees. It was all that I could afford at the time and it will surely help. Thanks Boss. 🙏🫶😘

Isaiah 41:10

[10] fear not, for I am with you;

be not dismayed, for I am your God;

I will strengthen you, I will help you,

I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

2 Samuel 22:2-3

[2] He said, 

“The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, 

[3]     my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge,

my shield, and the horn of my salvation,

my stronghold and my refuge,

my savior; you save me from violence.

Deuteronomy 31:6

[6] Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you.”

Isaiah 43:1-2

Israel’s Only Savior

[1] But now thus says the LORD,

he who created you, O Jacob,

he who formed you, O Israel:

“Fear not, for I have redeemed you;

I have called you by name, you are mine. 

[2] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;

and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;

when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,

and the flame shall not consume you.
