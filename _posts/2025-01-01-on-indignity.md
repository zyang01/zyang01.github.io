As alluded to previously, I don't know how to spell oversharing and I was a regular in Berghain’s basement as a rampant homosexual.

I struggled immensely with sexual desires. My solution was to distract myself by writing salty posts and building the project Bible Says Love (BibleSays.Love). I managed to resolve the urges myself a handful of times in my 14 weeks as a believer.

Unfortunately, I got too creative for my own good again and became even more rampant. Please hear me out. 🙏

I do not consider myself to be a former homosexual, but I also recognise homosexuality is considered to be an abomination in scripture, whilst keeping in mind the sociological background when they were written. To put it simply, I won’t attempt to justify my homosexuality and I can imagine my Heavenly Father and the angels facepalming when I conduct abominations in the dark. I do feel guilty and apologise to Him after I regained mind clarity through performing certain mechanical and biochemical processes with my body.

How then could I possibly feel justified and grow in holiness? I got exceptionally disappointed in myself last week, and I did not want Him to forgive me. Then I remembered hammer boi 🔨 from Wittenberg, Germany and the following passage from Mr Noisy Gong.

2 Corinthians 12:9

[9] But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

I agree with hammer boi 🔨 and believe that salvation is a gift of God’s grace through Jesus Christ received by faith and faith alone. I don't think any good work can save you if you haven't truly repented, and people who are truly saved will have the unstoppable urge to do good work. 🙈🫣🤡

Therefore, I believe out of everything that He wants to say to us, His children, through that incredibly annoyingly thick bestseller, He wants us to know that love comes first and foremost. This, however, only reassures me of His forgiveness, but I was still unable to forgive myself for going against His wishes.

Well… I came up with some whacky ideas to spread the gospel more effectively than STDs to my FWBs. As always, I went above and beyond and might sort out my finances by sharing deep knowledge in specific niches. 🙈

How much dignity would I forego? Well, He saved my life. I do fear His wrath, but my love for my community is greater than my fear of burning in hell for eternity. And no, I won’t share my OnlyFans page here. Turns out I do have a bottom line, for now anyway. 🤔🫣🥹

On a totally fictional note, how dramatic would it be if the Son of Man came back as a rampant homosexual? Might be humbling enough even for believers and shows God’s abundant mercy and relentless love. 🤔

Hebrews 11:31

[31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
