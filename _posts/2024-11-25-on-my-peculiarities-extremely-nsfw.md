Even though I trained as a classical and contemporary dancer, I have this weird mental block of looking at myself. I have taken less than a handful of selfies in the last decade, and my LinkedIn profile picture was previously a passport photo. The profile pic I have right now was taken by a friend when we were travelling in Paris, and they took it without my knowledge. I liked it because it's the only picture of myself that I seemed natural and content.

Now please brace yourselves, this salt is about to get hella potent.

Ever since I started exploring my sexuality when I was a teenager, I could not bear looking at my sexual partner and it would be a huge turnoff for me to do so. And over the last decade or so, I could only enjoy anonymous sex acts. This pretty much made committing sexual immorality impossible now that I know my Father and the angels are watching ALL THE TIME. ðŸ¥²ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜±

It also made touching myself rather difficult over the last couple of weeks, but I guess we all have a cross to bear. ðŸ˜”
