As alluded to in my previous post titled ‚Äú[On Solution to All Our Problems](../on-solution-all-our-problems){:target="_blank"}‚Äù, I don't think national governments will be able to provide the solution to the [tsunami brought about by Artificial Intelligence (AI) within 2 years](../on-throwing-up){:target="_blank"}. ChatGPT was launched 2 years ago in November 2022 and it's capable of [doing aerodynamics in seconds](../on-aerodynamics){:target="_blank"} right now. Only the Lord knows what it will be capable of in 2 more years.

The way COVID was handled also showed how incapable and inefficient governments are and in my humble opinion, most bipartisan or parliamentary systems are just a game of musical chairs exploiting the short memory span of the population. I have seen first-hand the trauma of unrest caused by geopolitical conflicts in Hong Kong.

What could protesting on the streets possibly do when they have facial recognition and the ability to cut you off from the entire electronic payment system that's everywhere nowadays?

A lot of people are going to need our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ soon. Only God can help us now.

Take care, best wishes and God bless. üôè

John 6:35-40

[35] Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúI am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. [36] But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. [37] All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. [38] For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. [39] And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. [40] For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.‚Äù
