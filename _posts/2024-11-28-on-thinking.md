All the thinking I have done in the first 27 years of my life resulted in a gigantic fire as shown in my previous post titled ‚ÄúOn My Mess‚Äù.

The lesson I have learned in the last 9 weeks and 4 days with my Boss is I will only fall if I run in front of Him, and He has to come over, pick me up, dust me off and wipe my tears again.

So I'm like Dude you tell me what to do and I will do it every day. ü§∑

I think within the confines He outlines, and I sleep like a baby every day. ü§§

On the second day of His first visit back in August, after that sensorial experience as described in my previous posts, I thought if that was God then did He give me superpowers? I knew nothing about the Holy Spirit at that point and it wasn't until a week later that I told my Christ bro therapist about it and he pointed me to the Baptism with the Holy Spirit on Wikipedia.

I think maybe He did give me superpowers, to sleep like a baby at least. ü§îüò¨ü§§

Matthew 6:34

[34] ‚ÄúTherefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

Philippians 4:6-7

[6] do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. [7] And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

1 Peter 5:6-7

[6] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, [7] casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.

Isaiah 41:10

[10] fear not, for I am with you;

be not dismayed, for I am your God;

I will strengthen you, I will help you,

I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

Romans 8:28-30

[28] And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. [29] For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. [30] And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.
