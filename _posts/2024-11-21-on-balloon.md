It feels like the first 27yrs of my life was an inflated balloon. He poked it, it exploded, and everything came out, with me kicking and screaming the whole time.

I rarely remember a time I was angry or mad since puberty, but I got so mad last Wednesday that I almost jumped on a flight to Israel. Despite my reluctance, I know deep down that He needs to knock down some stuff to help me build a new house on the rock rather than on the sand like I used to. 🙄

It still sucks a lot! 😠

Matthew 7:24-27

Build Your House on the Rock

[24] “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. [25] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. [26] And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [27] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”
