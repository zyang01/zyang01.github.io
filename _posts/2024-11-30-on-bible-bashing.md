A friend asked me why I am so aggressive with spreading the gospel, I'm paraphrasing here and the actual question was slightly more dismissive.

My answer was it's because I believe I'm saving lives and souls and used the analogy of drug use. If someone you care about is using hard drugs, would you not try to intervene? Or would you keep your concerns hidden and tell people who intend to intervene off by saying they should keep their concerns hidden as well?

I'm spreading the gospel because I care. The mankind’s best seller I shove to people I know is the NKJV Bible from Thomas Nelson with zippers so that they could be hugged to sleep without messing up the pages. The average cost is around £30 each and I dropped off two dozen at my former employer the other day.

All things considered, I'm doing extremely poorly when it comes to living conditions and personal finance, but I'm not chasing after earthly riches. I have also tasted God’s goodness and want to share it with everyone I know. If that's wrong and I'm being a fool then so be it. 🤡🤡🤡

Matthew 6:19-21

Lay Up Treasures in Heaven

[19] “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, [20] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. [21] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

1 Timothy 6:9-10

[9] But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. [10] For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.

Hebrews 13:5

[5] Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.”

Philippians 4:11-13

[11] Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. [12] I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. [13] I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

Colossians 3:2

[2] Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.

Matthew 19:21

[21] Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”

Psalm 34:8

[8] Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good!

Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!

Psalm 119:103

[103] How sweet are your words to my taste,

sweeter than honey to my mouth!
