Both got thrown in the trash bin ever since I invited Him to take up permanent residence in my life, after Romans 1-4 called me a sinner in my face. 🫠🙄😔

Most of the miracles and statistical anormalies are personal and highly context/experience dependent. If I were to tell them to people who don’t know me personally, they would probably just refer me to mental health services (don’t you dare, I will snitch on you to my Heavenly Father 😠). The ones I posted online in my previous posts are ones that I have objective evidence to back up on. Feel free to have a read and let me know how you think they are just confirmation bias or whatever. 🙏🫶😘

Matthew 19:23-26

[23] And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. [24] Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” [25] When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” [26] But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

John 20:30-31

The Purpose of This Book

[30] Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; [31] but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

Mark 5:34

[34] And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”
