It took about three hours from my mom calling me a failure and a disappointment to Him making me laugh thinking about meeting the legendary noisy gong on the day I get to heaven.

Q.E.D.

And my mom just called me an ungrateful bastard after reminding me of the times she bought me toys in Hong Kong, which jogged my memory and I do remember them now. So I guess I'm indeed a piece of shit on this earth. I'm not sure if she read the first paragraph in my previous post titled “On My Parents” or any of the biblical passages below that post tho.

Anyway, I'm gonna go play with my drone and drop some testimonies. ✈️🚀🛸

1 John 4:9-10

[9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
