Here is my confession.

I have not only committed all of the seven deadly sins. Every time I accused someone of sinning against me, I have committed that very sin myself. On top of that, I have also committed blasphemy and (metaphorical) attempted murder of God almighty by stepping into His shoes and trying to see the world from His lenses post creation in a philosophical thought experiment, as well as living 27yrs of godless life as an agnostic. I was absolutely horrified by the loneliness of it all and respectfully returned His shoes and glasses. I can only pray for His forgiveness. 🙏

Dear Father, I'm really really really sorry. 😭

Edit: forgot to say I was a rampant homosexual and I think I’m still a homosexual. 🥺
