I turned Him down on the second day during His first visit back in late August. He asked me to think about why.

As discussed in my previous post titled “On the Holy Spirit and Miracles”, I was only 95% certain that God exists, since Spotify’s AI recommendations could theoretically be advanced enough to cause me to hallucinate. I couldn’t say with absolute certainty that it’s impossible. I haven’t kept up with the latest AI developments in psychology.

I told Him that the only things I could commit to 100% in this life are truth and reason, and I consider the greatest gift God gave me, assuming God does indeed exist, is my ability to reason and to seek the truth. He seemed okay with that. I actually left myself a way out in my response, because if He is indeed God, then what I should end up with at the end is Him regardless. I’m not afraid of turning Him down and walking the walk, even if at the end, I find out I got it wrong and He is indeed the truth and the way. There is nothing wrong with making a mistake on the path to finding the truth, as long as I admit I got it wrong and get back onto the right path.

IMHO, refusing to admit we got it wrong – even though, deep down, we know we got it all wrong – is pride.

Who are we to think that we can comprehend, let alone wrestle with God? Having that thought in the first place, in my humble opinion, is pride as well.

John 14:1-7

I Am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life

[1] “Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. [2] In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? [3] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. [4] And you know the way to where I am going.” [5] Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” [6] Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. [7] If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”
