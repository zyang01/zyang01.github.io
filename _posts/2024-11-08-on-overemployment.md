Was kinda fun when I did 3/4 remote full time software engineer jobs whilst travelling. I have three sets of AirPods and developed the ability to join two stand ups at the same time. Kinda tiring to do 4/5hrs of meetings before noon tho and not massively motivated to write any code after lunch most days. 🥲

Travelled to Gran Canaria, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin, Munich, Antalya, and Dubai between August 2023 - April 2024.

I personally guarantee no trade secrets were shared amongst my employers and apologies for my lazy work ethics. Kinda needed to do that in order to support both of my younger siblings when they are studying as international students in London. Set six figures on fire every year for those two money shredding machines.

If you want to sue me then feel free to do so. I declared bankruptcy in the United Kingdom last week and cashing out of capitalism anyway.

If you want to send me to see Jesus, then the only thing I ask is please make sure it’s a kill shot. It would bug the heck out of me if I have to bleed to death.

Best wishes. 😘🫶🙏
