Despite my forgiveness and gratefulness, it still pains me every time I get in touch with the former friend and unfortunately the only way I could move on with my life is to remove any trace of their existence in my life. It still hurts a great deal for me to do so and the only comfort I find is from the passage below.

Matthew 10:12-14

[12] As you enter the house, greet it. [13] And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. [14] And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.
