Welcome to the first of a series of policy posts as I prepare to register a political party in Great Britain. I intend to apply the principles in my personal life where applicable. Someone has got to start walking in His statutes, observing His commandments, and doing them.

If you like to doubt, which is understandable given that we are all human and imperfect, I would like to paraphrase Boss Man by saying, "Go and learn what this means: 'He is the Lord our ***God***.'"

If you are a "believer" who "thinks" I have gone batshit crazy, then please consider whether trust and belief are [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation){:target="_blank"} and whether you truly believe if you consider me nuts. I would also strongly encourage you to take a revision course on the [definition of faith](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Hebrews%2011%3A1){:target="_blank"} outlined in Hebrews 11. We should stop this wishy-washy nonsense, and you are either in or you are out. No more foot in both camps bullshit.

## Edit

After publishing the original post, I was thinking about the next major policy item - education, which would be an exceptionally tricky area for obvious reasons. Then, I had the epiphany that I already had the answer in the original post. We need to stop making [the mistake](../on-genesis-3-fall-man/){:target="_blank"} we have been making since Genesis 3, the fall of man, and start putting God first rather than reason and end up with nothing but death. Seek Him first, and He will make our paths straight rather than lean on our insufficient understanding and go at it with our half-assed reasoning and comprehension.

### Proverbs 3:1–8

Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart

 [1] My son, do not forget my teaching,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but let your heart keep my commandments,  
 [2] for length of days and years of life  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and peace they will add to you.  

 [3] Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bind them around your neck;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write them on the tablet of your heart.  
 [4] So you will find favor and good success  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the sight of God and man.  

 **[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**and do not lean on your own understanding.**  
 **[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**and he will make straight your paths.**  
 [7] Be not wise in your own eyes;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.  
 [8] It will be healing to your flesh  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refreshment to your bones. (ESV)

I mentioned previously [the first call](../on-holy-spirit-miracles/){:target="_blank"} we had after not speaking for 11 years with my welcoming party lasted 6.5 hours. We were arguing about semantic differences in the Bible. Boss Man told me to make the argument known to you in this post. I was 100% certain God exists, but only 95% about Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour in that call. My welcoming party was trying to bash me into confessing Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour. My issue with that? Tomato, tomahto. I could not comprehend the significance of the name Jesus since it's written and pronounced differently in different languages. Why not stick with God when referring to God? Two days later, I read Romans 1-4 and felt the truth cutting through my bones into my soul. If you have never read Romans 1-4 before, Mr Noisy Gong kept talking about a Dude named Jesus Christ in it, which I later found out was a letter written to the Romans rather than a personal letter written to me by some dude named Roman. At that point, I was like "Okay, fine, all in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour."

Now, if you subscribe to a religion, which I do not, or you have yet to encounter God personally, perhaps due to learning whatever through doctrine written by some historical figures whose names are not on the No. 1 bestseller of humanity, then I would advise you to ask God with your heart to show you who He is. **We won't get anywhere unless we fix the immediate problem of people thinking you are nuts the moment you bring up the three-letter word *God*.** Our inability to let each other finish our sentences and instinctive rejection of God are getting ridiculous and out of control.

A new friend of mine mentioned the following highlighted verse from the Book of Joel yesterday.

### Joel 2:27–32

 [27] You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,  
  and that I am the LORD your God and there is none else.  
 And my people shall never again be put to shame.  

 The LORD Will Pour Out His Spirit  

 **[28] “And it shall come to pass afterward,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;**  
 **your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**your old men shall dream dreams,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**and your young men shall see visions.**  
 [29] Even on the male and female servants  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in those days I will pour out my Spirit.  

 [30] “And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. [31] The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. [32] And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls. (ESV)

According to my half-assed ChatGPT research, Joel is one of the twelve minor prophets like Jonah, but Joel is not lucky enough to be included in an Abrahamic religion like Jonah. However, Isaiah and Ezekiel are both recognised in all Abrahamic religions, which I do not subscribe to. So here you go.

### Isaiah 44:1–8

Israel the LORD’s Chosen

 [1] “But now hear, O Jacob my servant,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel whom I have chosen!  
 [2] Thus says the LORD who made you,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who formed you from the womb and will help you:  
 Fear not, O Jacob my servant,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeshurun whom I have chosen.  
 [3] For I will pour water on the thirsty land,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and streams on the dry ground;  
 **I will pour my Spirit upon your offspring,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my blessing on your descendants.  
 [4] They shall spring up among the grass  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like willows by flowing streams.  
 [5] This one will say, ‘I am the LORD’s,’  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another will call on the name of Jacob,  
 and another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and name himself by the name of Israel.”  

 Besides Me There Is No God  

 [6] Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts:  
 “I am the first and I am the last;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besides me there is no god.  
 [7] Who is like me? Let him proclaim it.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him declare and set it before me,  
 since I appointed an ancient people.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them declare what is to come, and what will happen.  
 [8] Fear not, nor be afraid;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have I not told you from of old and declared it?  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you are my witnesses!  
 Is there a God besides me?  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no Rock; I know not any.” (ESV)  

### Ezekiel 39:25–29

The LORD Will Restore Israel

[25] “Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for my holy name. [26] They shall forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid, [27] when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies’ lands, and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations. [28] Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore. **[29] And I will not hide my face anymore from them, when I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.”** (ESV)

## Challenge

I inquired about Him once in the first 27 years of my life, and He showed up five weeks later. Do you dare to have a go? I dare you, bitch.

## Matthew 6:25–34

Do Not Be Anxious

[25] “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. **[33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.**

**[34] “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.** (ESV)

## Leviticus 26:1–13

Blessings for Obedience

[1] “You shall not make idols for yourselves or erect an image or pillar, and you shall not set up a figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God. [2] You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.

**[3] “If you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them, [4] then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. [5] Your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing. And you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely.** [6] I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land. [7] You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. [8] Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. [9] I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you. [10] You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new. [11] I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. [12] And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people. [13] I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect. (ESV)

## Ezekiel 36:22–32

I Will Put My Spirit Within You

[22] “Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. [23] And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. [24] I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. **[25] I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. [26] And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. [27] And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.** [28] You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. [29] And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. And I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. [30] I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. [31] Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations. [32] It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel. (ESV)

## Deuteronomy 10:12–22

Circumcise Your Heart

**[12] “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, [13] and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today for your good? [14] Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. [15] Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. [16] Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.** [17] For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. [18] He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. [19] Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. [20] You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear. [21] He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen. [22] Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven. (ESV)

## Proverbs 10:21–23

 [21] The lips of the righteous feed many,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but fools die for lack of sense.  
 **[22] The blessing of the LORD makes rich,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**and he adds no sorrow with it.**  
 [23] Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding. (ESV)  

## Ecclesiastes 5:8–20

The Vanity of Wealth and Honor

[8] If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them. [9] But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.

**[10] He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.** [11] When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? [12] Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.

[13] There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, [14] and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. [15] As he came from his mother’s womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. [16] This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind? [17] Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.

[18] Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. [19] Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is the gift of God. [20] For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart. (ESV)

## 1 Timothy 6:6–10

[6] But godliness with contentment is great gain, [7] for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. [8] But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. [9] But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. **[10] For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.** (ESV)

## Luke 12:13–15

The Parable of the Rich Fool

[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” [14] But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” **[15] And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”** (ESV)

## 2 Corinthians 9:6–9

The Cheerful Giver

[6] The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. [7] Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. **[8] And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.** [9] As it is written,

 “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his righteousness endures forever.” (ESV)  

## Matthew 6:24

**[24] “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.** (ESV)

## Philippians 4:10–20

God’s Provision

[10] I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. [11] Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned, in whatever situation I am, to be content. **[12] I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. [13] I can do all things through him who strengthens me.**

[14] Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. [15] And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. [16] Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. [17] Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. **[18] I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. [19] And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. [20] To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.** (ESV)

## Malachi 3:6–15

Robbing God

[6] “For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. [7] From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, ‘How shall we return?’ [8] Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. [9] You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. **[10] Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.** [11] I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts. [12] Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.

**[13] “Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’ [14] You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts? [15] And now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper but they put God to the test and they escape.’”** (ESV)

### Lyrics

任路人避一陣雨  
雨過後再未重遇  
我卻死心塌地 呆站在原處  
只有青春有甚麼可以輸  

雨季走了突來暴雪  
雪再飄過換寒暑  
兩腳即使顫動 情緒卻鎖住  
一片忠心這是我的短處  

耐性的比賽 像隻忠犬的愛  
長流細水編織典故方可以跨世代  
善良的車站 盡其一生替戀人乘載  
風雪我都依然觀賞尾班車開  

被雪花淹蓋 蒙著兩眼看將來  
人潮暗湧一心找你充滿絕望和期待  
自殘式忍耐 歷遍春花秋葉從沒有悔改  
當你的芳蹤也石沉大海  

背唱片店自言自語  
語氣輕似唸情書  
信有一千歲命 時間太充裕  
所有光陰押下我的賭注  

耐性的比賽 像隻忠犬的愛  
長流細水編織典故方可以跨世代  
善良的車站 盡其一生替戀人乘載  
相信有生之年總可妄想天開  

被雪花淹蓋 蒙著兩眼看將來  
人潮暗湧一心找你充滿絕望和期待  
自殘式忍耐 歷遍春花秋葉從沒有悔改  
會有歷史記載 令後代動容的愛  

耐性的比賽 直到風光不再  
原來澀谷東急總店消失我都會在  
做遊客地標 讓每一位因為我等到所愛  
所以我等不來亦視為很應該  

像潦倒乞丐 垂垂老矣也痴呆  
繁榮會死比不起我這故事更令別人無奈  
任誰勸喻移不開一千個萬年爭取一夕愛  

自鳴年紀輕斗膽與愛競賽  
萬年後今天待旁觀者感慨
