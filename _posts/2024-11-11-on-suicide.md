A friend of mine said my recent posts are rather humorous and thought I was joking. There is nothing but the truth underneath all the humour.

I nearly threw myself off the balcony in my London home on the fifth floor right in front of my younger sister back in August. A lot happened over the last 12 months, and it was essentially betrayal after betrayal by the people I trust in life. The only thing that held me back from skipping over the balcony railing that day was [my love for my younger brother](../on-brotherly-love-loyalty-faithfulness/){:target="_blank"}. And my former friend’s betrayal essentially threw my younger brother’s academic future into the bin. If He didn’t [come to the rescue](../on-holy-spirit-miracles/){:target="_blank"}, I wouldn’t be writing this post right now. My humour comes from Holy Spirit the comforter.

My loyalty and faithfulness belong to Him and Him only for the rest of my time on this earth. I go wherever He points, no questions asked.
