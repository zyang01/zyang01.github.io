I thought I was entrusting my heart to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ going forward, but I realised my heart was never mine anyway. I was a slave all my life, and my heart was chained by my parents, siblings, and friends, most of whom take more than they give. But that doesn’t mean I’m faultless at all, on the contrary, I’m immeasurably guilty.

Nietzsche said God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed Him. Mankind will stand trial for God’s murder and blasphemy one day. And yet, salvation is as easy as repentance by sincere recognition of one’s fault. Christ had already paid the ultimate price on the cross.

Regardless, I want to apologise to my parents, siblings and friends. I’m probably not going to be able to fulfil all of the promises I made this life. There is a little something I would like to try saving, and I don’t mind die trying.

See you all and have fun on judgement day. 🙏🫶😘
