After the recent heavy posts, time to get back to some shameless begging and cash in whatever little sympathy I may have earned in people's hearts. 😬

I did ask the Lord about it, but He said He ain't gonna give me a dollar. And He also said He ain't my mama and won't do my laundry for me. 🤷🤦🙄

It seems like the market demand for church janitors isn't that strong right now and I haven't got around to properly looking yet due to recent travels. Heading to YMCA later to see if there's any suitable opportunities available. 😭

Due to my negligence, I forgot about the fact that my connections are mainly made up of crypto/tech bros and probably don't use Visa/MasterCard anymore. So please find below my crypto wallet addresses if you would like to buy me a coffee or something.
