This is a nerd post.

As mentioned in my previous post titled “[On Email](../on-email){:target="_blank"}”, I posted around 50,000 warning letters to email addresses in the United Kingdom and broke the view counter on the site that was hosting my blog. I spent an entire day yesterday migrating all my posts to a static site generated with Jekyll in preparation for the incoming traffic once I start [delivering the warning letter in billions](../on-thou-shalt-send-it){:target="_blank"}.

If you work for the company [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/){:target="_blank"} and would like to up your game, the talented engineers at a [former employer of mine](../on-acute-chemical-toxicity-uranium){:target="_blank"} might discover their conscience and decide to do something useful with their lives. Just so you know. 😬😉🥹

The new blog can be found on [Blog.BibleSays.Love](https://blog.biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"}, I still have some cleanup to do when it comes to URL redirects and DNS settings, but once the migration is complete the entire user-facing part of the project [Bible Says Love](../on-cheating-bible-says-love){:target="_blank"} will be hosted on Cloudflare.

For those of you who don't know, Cloudflare is a global content delivery network (CDN) and a cloud security company. It’s estimated that [around 20% of the websites in the world use Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-annual-founders-letter-2022/){:target="_blank"}. The most insane part is the [hosting cost to me personally is zero](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/developer-platform/){:target="_blank"} even if a couple of billion users decide to show up in the next 24hrs. The entire deployment of the project [Bible Says Love](../on-cheating-bible-says-love){:target="_blank"} is serverless and the only part that incurs costs is when a user submits a query to ask what the Bible says about a certain topic. The [cost per million queries is less than a cup of coffee (£4/$5)](../on-what-i-think-will-happen){:target="_blank"} for processing on OpenAI’s GPT-4o model and Cloudflare Workers to relay the requests and responses. That being said, still [running out of coffee](https://donate.stripe.com/3cs0403mi5CQ7UA9AA){:target="_blank"} fast. 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉

The email service I used wants to charge £0.54/$0.67 per thousand emails sent. Ain't got that kinda money when I'm bankrupt and no one [buys me coffee](https://donate.stripe.com/3cs0403mi5CQ7UA9AA){:target="_blank"}. 🫣😳☹️

So I did some research into setting up a self-hosted email infrastructure. Once I have the IP addresses warmed up, I can deliver over a billion warning letters per month easy for less than 10 cups of coffee (£40/$50). I think we should replace money and use coffee as the standard unit of measurement going forward. 🤔🤔🤔

Anyway, hope you enjoy reading on the [new site](https://blog.biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"}. I have got some IP addresses to warm up, some prophecies to fulfil and a fire to start. 🙏🫶😘
