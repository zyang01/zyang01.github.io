On second thought, I can't wait for the free publicity that comes with legal troubles. Just imagine the front page news and definitely saves me from another drone crash as well.

I might just enjoy the involuntary prison sex. Been a while since I visited Berlin. 🥹

Bring it on, anyone is welcome to have a go. 🙏🫶😘

Remember, my middle name is Troublemaker.

Philippians 1:12-14

The Advance of the Gospel

[12] I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, [13] so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. [14] And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
