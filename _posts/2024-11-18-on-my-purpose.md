This is confirmed by the Holy Spirit (brain massage level of strength 🤤) when I was smoking outside of a Vietnamese restaurant in California. I was having a smoking break half way through having Pho with my aunt, who’s been a believer for 12 years.

I believe He brought me into this world to witness, testify and judge.

Ask your Holy Spirit for confirmation if you don’t believe me. 😉

As for unbelievers, I don’t give a puppy poop if you believe me or not. 😊

As always, be blessed and have fun on judgement day. 🙏🫶😘
