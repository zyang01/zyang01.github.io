🚨🚨🚨Trigger Warning🚨🚨🚨: This post will offend catholics.

Firstly, this post is simply my personal opinion based on the preliminary research I have done so far regarding the various Christian denominations and everything I write here will be subject to corrections, and any input/feedback will be very much appreciated. After all, I have only gone all-in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour less than six weeks ago, and I'm super-duper ignorant on all matters Christian. 🙏

Thou shalt not worship false idols.

IMHO, the pope is a false idol and should not have equal standing as scripture. I believe everyone should read the Word of God themselves and it's okay to ask for help with understanding it, but no human being should have the authority to decide how to interpret scripture.

Furthermore, I believe one should ask God the Father directly in their prayers for things that they want, rather than through saints and apostles. This is worshiping false idols all over again, and commercialising God through the selling of prayer/holy cards.

Joel 3:3

[3] and have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it. (ESV)

I believe the boy referred to here is Jesus Christ and feel free to infer the rest based on certain contexts.

Lastly, I'm aware that sexual abuse is a global issue, but if I were to pick a top offender that systematically covered up abuses and pushed people away from God, you can probably take an educated guess.

I believe I'm a Baptist since the first church He led me to was a Baptist church, before I even knew what the various Christian denominations meant. I was so ignorant that I thought the various denominations were at war with each other in the early phase of discovering my faith. Upon further research on the principles each denomination represents, I realised if I were to pick one myself, the Baptists' philosophy is the closest to my personal philosophy. He knew. 🙄

I also discovered that Modern Baptist churches trace their roots back to the Protestant Reformation, which separated from the Roman Catholic Church. I guess the Catholic Church was once "fruitful".
