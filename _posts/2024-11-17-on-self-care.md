I ran around giving my testimony to people I know from my old life quite a lot lately. One thing I noticed is everyone keeps telling me to care more about my own wellbeing. Could we fucking stop putting ourselves first and care more about each other?

One striking difference I noticed between believers and unbelievers is unbelievers are nice to you in person and on paper, but when push comes to shove they almost never come through. Believers will do all they could to help you. I get hurt dealing with unbelievers, and go to church to get healed by the warmth brought about by believers. Rinse and repeat.
