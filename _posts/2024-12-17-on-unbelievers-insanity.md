As alluded to in my previous posts, [I'm basically insane](../on-my-sanity){:target="_blank"}.

A quick reminder for those of you who haven't read my posts possibly due to being busy chasing after money or whatever. Taking the leap of faith is the same as going insane because you believe He will catch you rather than letting you smash to the ground based on faith and faith alone rather than reason.

I would like to argue that unbelievers are even more insane because [they took a leap of faith their entire lives without knowing](../on-faith-precedes-reason){:target="_blank"}. At the very least, I took my leap of faith knowingly and I know He will catch me. I think the unbelievers took a blind leap of faith without knowing, and [they gonna smash straight through the ground into hell soon](../on-two-masters-god-money){:target="_blank"}. Ouch. ðŸ˜³ðŸ«£ðŸ˜±

Luke 12:4-5

Have No Fear

[4] â€œI tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. [5] But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!
