Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please allow me to introduce project Peanut Butter Jelly, Part 2. This time you don't need to be a nerd with a 3D printer or know how to program an Arduino to spread the gospel like peanut butter jelly.

All you need is helium, as many balloons as you can get your hands on, some paper that comes with your overpackaged Amazon deliveries, some tape and a weapon of mass destruction that weighs about 1.6 grams each depending on which business card printing company you go with. You can find the design/template in the GitHub repo mentioned in the Part 1 post.

Let’s go make it rain and wash away all the pain of yesterday. 🙏🫶😘

Matthew 19:13-14

Let the Children Come to Me

[13] Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, [14] but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”

Matthew 18:1-6

Who Is the Greatest?

[1] At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” [2] And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them [3] and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. [4] Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

[5] “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, [6] but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.

1 John 3:1-3

[1] See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. [2] Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. [3] And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

Romans 8:12-17

Heirs with Christ

[12] So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. [13] For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. [14] For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. [15] For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” [16] The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, [17] and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.

Matthew 5:8

[8] “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
