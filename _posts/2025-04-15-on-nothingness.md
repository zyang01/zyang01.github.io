Jesus Christ, what a Glorious and Holy Name; what a King of Kings!

And I have not finished three out of the four gospels. I quickly flipped through Matthew once on my way to Moscow.

The truth does set you free. It is not just any truth. It is THE TRUTH written on humanity's bestseller, the Holy Bible, which contains both the Old Testament and the New Testament. If you have never opened one before, my guess is you would be quite annoyed when you open one for the first time. But I can testify and say that it contains 1,000,000,000% good stuff, the best stuff. I would suggest starting with the four gospels, Matthew, Luke, Mark and John. And then just let Him guide you and wing it, which is how I think one should live life anyway. Let Boss Man show you a surprise beyond your wildest imagination around every corner, and just enjoy the ride and thank Him when you get a chance to catch a breadth. I'm going back to start over again.

And He does answer prayers. I called for the first time in my life back in July last year. And Dude showed up five weeks later to save me. I asked Him to allow me to save some rampant homosexuals before I even read the Book of Jonah. It took less than 30 weeks. I need to learn to be patient. The good stuff takes time and the Maestro's work is just absolutely sick, majestic and renders one speechless.

Anyway, I have got a water baptism to attend this weekend. That is a wrap for [GonnaBeLit: He Said Love](https://gonnabelit.com/){:target="_blank"}. The follow-up series is in production, and updates will be posted on [Suffering One](https://suffering.one){:target="_blank"}.

Halle-fucking-lujah! And enjoy.

P.S. I tried taking the shortcut using ProtonMail. Got bounced straight away by their email server due to 100x recipients. I'm gonna stop taking shortcuts. Yes, Boss; okay, Boss; Your Wish is my Command, Boss. Lesson learned.

Matthew 7:12–14

The Golden Rule

[12] “So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

[13] “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. [14] For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)
