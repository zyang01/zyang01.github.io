I made a new friend recentlyâ€”a fellow computer scientist/software engineer who suspiciously knows too much philosophy and was lurking around a WhatsApp group chat. The dude is super weird, does not have a phone and uses an Oyster card. I cannot be late for more than 20-30min of our agreed meeting time. And there is no backing out at the last minute.

Frankly, I might enjoy that way of life. I already got quite into self-hosting. Things stopped working one by one as I went broke, friends first, then iCloud and 1Password. The only reason why I still haven't sold my iPhone is because of the various chat applications, including but not limited to WhatsApp and WeChat. I did not expect to share the Martin Luther meme in my treasured meme collection one day, but life stopped making sense last October. I stopped worrying about tomorrow and just took it day by day without any expectations.

After a recent realisation, I think true friends would make more than an effort to arrive on time. I have got an iPhone 15 Pro to sell.

The only issue is the dude went to a catholic school.
