Dear LinkedIn Stalker,

Mind showing a brother some love and buy me a coffee? 😬 Still got my LinkedIn premium and you know who you are. 🙃

Don’t know what your retirement plans are, but some good will might get you a penthouse upgrade with a lake view in heaven or something. You never know. 🤷

Please do so next time you walk past a homeless person as well, they are God’s children too.

You can buy me a coffee at https://buymeacoffee.com/aaronyangi

P.S. Yo, Mr. Ollie James wanna buy a former colleague a coffee? How’s your leg? Still broken? Don’t be naughty next time and will pray for your speedy recovery. 😘🫶🙏
