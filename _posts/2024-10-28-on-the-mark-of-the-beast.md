Some random thoughts on the mark of the beast in the book of revelation.

I got rather scared the first couple of times I read the book. Mainly due to the relatively small number of those who actually get saved at the end times compared to the number of Christians in the world, based on my literal reading of the book as a recent convert.

I have a suspicion that the mark of the beast 666 is not an actual mark in the physical world, but a mark in the spiritual world. In the book of revelation, it says the mark will be on people‚Äôs foreheads and right hands. The idea of having 666 tattooed on people's foreheads nowadays in the physical world seem rather insane even for someone as far gone as me, and I don't see how it could actually happen given we also have the warning in scripture. I believe the right hand symbolises righteousness in scripture. How many people in this world still consider God to be righteous rather than consider money to be righteous, and have God in their mind rather than money? It says people cannot buy or sell without it, perhaps that's just money. When push comes to shove and even amongst Christians, how many would actually choose to stand firmly with God rather than money? So I think 666 is a spiritual mark and it represents money or the love of it in the real world. Any thoughts and inputs regarding this theory would be much appreciated. üôè
