Just a quick follow-up on my previous post. If you had no clue what I was on about, then crashing the party wonâ€™t work either, because we will be communicating in a language you can hear but wonâ€™t understand.

I tried, somewhat forcefully on occasions, to help the blind people in my life recover vision, but I had zero success so far. It appears that Boss Man didn't choose them because they defiled themselves by committing adultery with the Whore of Babylon. ðŸ«£ðŸ«£ðŸ«£

A free Chinese language lesson for you today, the Chinese character for Lamb is ç¾Š (pronounced yÃ¡ng).

Happy New Year boys and girls. I will see some of you around midnight in the valley where the kids collide. And party till the morning.

Revelation 14:2-5

[2] And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps, [3] and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. [4] It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb, [5] and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are blameless.
