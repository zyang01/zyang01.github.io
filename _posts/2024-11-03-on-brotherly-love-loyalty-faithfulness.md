When I went to my first Sunday church service, a member of the congregation mentioned that my English first name Aaron is also very biblical. I then read the story of Aaron and his younger brother Moses. I cried after reading the friendship between them, because they reminded me of my relationship with my younger brother. My younger brother just started his first year at Queen Mary reading economics, but is forced to take another gap year due to my inability to financially support him in light of recent events.

I asked a former friend of mine for help back in August for a loan that would not only allow my younger brother to continue his study, but also help me to stand back up in life. They refused despite my pleading, kicked me out and slammed the door in my face. I once thought they would always have my back since I have been faithful and loyal to them all these years, despite the fact that I could have walked away from our financial arrangements little over a year ago after receiving indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. They practically mentally tortured me for six months, and it was the main driver behind taking a break at the campsite back in April. Even after everything they had put me through over the last 12 months, I still wanted to share the gospel with them and hoped that they would see the light, until they threw scripture in my face, accused me of not knowing God’s love, and claimed that it is prideful to want to save others. I realised there’s nothing more I could do at that point, because if Jesus returns tomorrow and offers them salvation, then they would also accuse Jesus of being prideful and not knowing love. I was only saved six weeks ago, what could I possibly do if even Jesus can’t offer them help?

If I had to take a guess as to why He decided to save me, I would say it's probably because I'm loyal and faithful even to the point of death.

I pledged to be His loyal servant forever and ever back in September. May His will be done, and I know for certain His will will be done.
