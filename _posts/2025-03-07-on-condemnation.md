I recently added the following sentence to the blog tagline and description: I do not seek to condemn, even though telling the truth can be easily interpreted as such. I also added the sentence about my not-yet-beautiful but truthful testimony, but that's a topic for another day.

As mentioned in a previous post, I read the Book of Hebrews several weeks ago. After reading the following passage from Hebrews 11 and looking back at the crazy stunt I pulled in mainland China on my second week as a believer, I sincerely wish that it was just a coincidence and a crazy stunt I somehow managed to pull.

## Hebrews 11:7

[7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. (ESV)

I briefly explained my motives in previous posts. Even though I believed that going into mainland China for the three-day mission could potentially stop the Book of Revelation, I did not believe I alone could stop the Book of Revelation. I believed that He could stop the Book of Revelation, and all that I needed to do was to fulfil the prophecy of the sign of Jonah, just in case I was indeed the sign of Jonah given how much the Book of Jonah resonated with the story of my life. I could not in good conscience not go through with the stunt and let the Book of Revelation take place considering the suffering and punishment described in the book. If you read my posts, you will know why I believe the Book of Revelation to be real and truthful. You are more than welcome to claim that all the evidence I presented was merely coincidences, but they are personally coincidental enough for me to take action regardless of the likelihood of what I believe will happen. I would take that leap of faith as long as there is a non-zero probability to avoid it all. Wouldn't you?

## Jonah 3:6–10

The People of Nineveh Repent

[6] The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. [7] And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water, [8] but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. [9] Who knows? God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish.”

[10] When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it. (ESV)

I asked a friend recently whether they believe I'm willing to lay down my life for them. They chose not to reply to that specific question. Back in early September of last year, I realised one evening that a friend of mine had gone radio silent for a couple of days and they weren't picking up their phone. I decided to jump in an Uber and went to their parent's house at midnight to make sure they were okay. No one answered the door that evening and I managed to leave a message by asking a neighbour for some pen and paper. Their parent informed me the following morning that they were having a rough time due to relationship issues. Another friend of mine recently informed me that the stunt I pulled in mainland China meant nothing since there is religious freedom in mainland China and Chinese law enforcement agencies are reasonable.

## John 15:12–17

[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)

In this faith journey of 23 weeks and 5 days, I learned that if I were to slip and break my neck in the shower today, there is only one person who would come for me and He is not in my WhatsApp or WeChat contacts. Frankly, I'm not even sure whether cutting my chest open, ripping my heart out, and placing it right in front of my WhatsApp and WeChat contacts would be sufficient to make them believe.

## Luke 4:23

[23] And he said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘“Physician, heal yourself.” What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.’” (ESV)

Such is the state of faith in my generation. I sincerely hope that was merely a stunt.

## Hebrews 11

By Faith

[1] Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. [2] For by it the people of old received their commendation. [3] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.

[4] By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. [5] By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. [6] And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. [7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.

[8] By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. [9] By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. [10] For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God. [11] By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. [12] Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.

[13] These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. [14] For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. [15] If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. [16] But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.

[17] By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. [20] By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. [21] By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. [22] By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.

[23] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. [24] By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, [25] choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. [26] He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. [27] By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. [28] By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.

[29] By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned. [30] By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. [31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.

[32] And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—[33] who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, [34] quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. [35] Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. [36] Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. [37] They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—[38] of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

[39] And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, [40] since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect. (ESV)
