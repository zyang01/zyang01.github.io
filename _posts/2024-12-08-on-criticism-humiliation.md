As alluded to in my previous post titled “On Shame”, I'm quite shameless nowadays and don’t mind being humiliated by anyone including modest scholars and academics as an amateur WhatsApp philosopher. For the first 27 years of my life, I was an extremely reserved guy and you wouldn't be able to find more than a handful of photos of me on the internet, let alone my opinions or what I think. I'm an INTJ-A btw if you're into MBTI.

I have also been trying to be extremely salty in my posts and have been doling out rather sarcastic posts left and right picking fights with everyone. The main purpose is to attract criticism so that I can learn about a wide range of topics that I didn't receive a formal education on. Didn't mean to offend anyone and sincere apologies if that's how my posts are received. 🙏🫶😘

I don't mind getting humiliated for the sake of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I'm just a servant and big deal if He needs to teach me a lesson through humiliation to humble me.

Hebrews 12:3-8

Do Not Grow Weary

[3] Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. [4] In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. [5] And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? 

“My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,

nor be weary when reproved by him. 

[6] For the Lord disciplines the one he loves,

and chastises every son whom he receives.”

[7] It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? [8] If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.

Proverbs 3:11-12

[11] My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline

or be weary of his reproof, 

[12] for the LORD reproves him whom he loves,

as a father the son in whom he delights.

Proverbs 12:1

[1] Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,

but he who hates reproof is stupid.

Proverbs 27:5-6

[5] 

Better is open rebuke

than hidden love. 

[6] 

Faithful are the wounds of a friend;

profuse are the kisses of an enemy.

2 Samuel 7:14

[14] I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,

P.S. I hope the pun is unintended in the last one. Had enough of that in the first 27 years of my life as a rampant homosexual. 😞🫣🥲

Edit: grammar.
