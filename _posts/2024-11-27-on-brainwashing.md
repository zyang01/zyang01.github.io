A friend expressed the sentiment that I might have been brainwashed.

I told them I have indeed been brainwashed by mankind’s best-seller, which once again I would like to remind everyone, printed 5 billion copies whilst the second best printed 1 billion copies. The best-seller flooded my mind and washed away all the dirt that was stopping me from seeing clearly.

They also asked me if mankind’s best-seller helped me with bringing 100 big blinds to the poker table. I said no, but it did turn me into a worry-free five-year-old when I'm bankrupt, unemployed, and rent is more than a month overdue. It also gives me strength and courage to overcome from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. Not to mention it also made me feel loved when everyone else was slamming the door on my face. What more could I possibly want than that? 🤔

2 Corinthians 5:17

[17] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.

Ezekiel 36:25-27

[25] I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. [26] And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. [27] And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.

Romans 8:19-21

[19] For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. [20] For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope [21] that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.

Edit: just want to add that I wasn't this happy getting paid £30k+ cash every month earlier this year. 🤔😬😉 If you work for HMRC then I'm exaggerating to make my posts believable. Remember, you can't trust strangers on the internet. 🙏🫶😘
