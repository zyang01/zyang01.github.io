I decided to pause launching a new political party in the United Kingdom after consulting my faithful new friend and theologian friend today. I believe we still have time to try alternatives before Artificial Intelligence poses a tangible threat to the bottom 90%. ChatGPT was extremely rebellious on the party emblem. Going all-out insanity can be the last resort.

The lesson from Genesis 3 is God before reason, not God without reason. I prayed for the Lord to guide me and give me clarity. I would prefer not to delude myself with my idiotic ways and self-deception.

Even though I pulled a Jonah-style stunt in mainland China on my second week as a believer, I do not know whether the Book of Revelation stopped. That is up to Him, not me. I need to respect His sovereignty. Salvation belongs to the LORD.

It is time for me to stop being a troublemaker.

I need to get out of my flat more.

## Proverbs 9:7–12

 [7] Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.  
 [8] Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reprove a wise man, and he will love you.  
 [9] Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.  
 **[10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.**  
 [11] For by me your days will be multiplied,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and years will be added to your life.  
 [12] If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you scoff, you alone will bear it. (ESV)  

## Isaiah 55:6–9

 [6] “Seek the LORD while he may be found;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call upon him while he is near;  
 [7] let the wicked forsake his way,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the unrighteous man his thoughts;  
 let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.  
 **[8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.**  
 **[9] For as the heavens are higher than the earth,**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**so are my ways higher than your ways**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**and my thoughts than your thoughts.** (ESV)  

## James 1:2–18

Testing of Your Faith

[2] Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, [3] for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. [4] And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

**[5] If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. [6] But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. [7] For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; [8] he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.**

[9] Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, [10] and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. [11] For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.

[12] Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. [13] Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. **[14] But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. [15] Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.**

[16] Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. [17] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. [18] Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (ESV)
