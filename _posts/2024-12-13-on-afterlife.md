For the first 27 years of my former life as an agnostic, I never really thought about the afterlife. If you read my origin story on real-life-fantasy(dot)com, you will know that I had a pretty decent life until the events in the last 12 months. I was always grateful for the ups and downs I had and always thought it would be the same as before I was born after I passed away. I was content back then and I should be content after.

Even now with a new life as a Christian and as alluded to in my previous posts, especially the post titled “On Thy Will Be Done”, I don't really think much about the afterlife and I don't even care if I end up burning in hell for eternity. All I know is I'm happy as a worry-free five-year-old every day and have someone I love with all my heart and soul walking with me every single moment, despite how much He annoys the heck out of me sometimes. Not to mention He also saved my life back in August.

I do look forward to meeting Mr Noisy Gong one day though.

Ecclesiastes 12:7

[7] and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.

John 14:2-3

[2] In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? [3] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.

P.S. The author of Ecclesiastes sounds like the OG existentialist to me. 🤔
