You can watch the discussion on AI that took place in the gigantic fig tree in Rome, Italy via [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGgOsUWbo0k){:target="_blank"} on YouTube.

The talk is quite long and I fell asleep listening to it, but the most important bit is in the first 5 minutes. It demonstrates the point I was trying to make in my previous post titled “[On the Dangers of AI 🚨🚨🚨](../on-dangers-ai){:target="_blank"}”. If you are from mainland China or don't have access to YouTube, the first 5 minutes of the video can be found below.

Get your lazy ass to church and get a physical Bible, please. 🙏🫶😘

2 Thessalonians 2:3-4

[3] Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, [4] who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.
