Proverbs 17:28

[28] 

Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise;

when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent.

James 1:19

Hearing and Doing the Word

[19] Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;

Proverbs 31:8-9

[8] Open your mouth for the mute,

for the rights of all who are destitute. 

[9] Open your mouth, judge righteously,

defend the rights of the poor and needy.

Ezekiel 3:18-19

[18] If I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. [19] But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
