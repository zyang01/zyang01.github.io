I think I'm gonna try abstinence until my Boss comes back and ask Him daily for strength and courage to overcome. I know it will be hard, pun very much unintended, but I think the cost-benefit ratio makes sense. 🥹

Dude definitely knows how much I freaking love an impossible challenge. 🙈

Also, every time I have impure thoughts in my mind, I just imagine my Boss and the angels facepalming in heaven. 🤦‍♂️🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦

Edit: cost-benefit rather than risk-reward.
