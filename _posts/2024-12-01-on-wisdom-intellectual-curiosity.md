Where are they? Can't seem to find any on LinkedIn all day. All I see is fool’s gold everywhere. 🤔😳🫣

Psalm 14

The Fool Says, There Is No God

To the choirmaster. Of David.

[1] The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”

They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds;

there is none who does good.

[2] The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man,

to see if there are any who understand,

who seek after God.

[3] They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt;

there is none who does good,

not even one.

[4] Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers

who eat up my people as they eat bread

and do not call upon the LORD?

[5] There they are in great terror,

for God is with the generation of the righteous. 

[6] You would shame the plans of the poor,

but the LORD is his refuge.

[7] Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!

When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,

let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.

Proverbs 1:7

[7] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge;

fools despise wisdom and instruction.

Proverbs 18:2-5

[2] 

A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,

but only in expressing his opinion. 

[3] 

When wickedness comes, contempt comes also,

and with dishonor comes disgrace. 

[4] 

The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters;

the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. 

[5] 

It is not good to be partial to the wicked

or to deprive the righteous of justice.

Ecclesiastes 10:14

[14] A fool multiplies words,

though no man knows what is to be,

and who can tell him what will be after him?

Proverbs 14:16

[16] 

One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil,

but a fool is reckless and careless.

Proverbs 12:15-22

[15] 

The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,

but a wise man listens to advice. 

[16] 

The vexation of a fool is known at once,

but the prudent ignores an insult. 

[17] 

Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence,

but a false witness utters deceit. 

[18] 

There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,

but the tongue of the wise brings healing. 

[19] 

Truthful lips endure forever,

but a lying tongue is but for a moment. 

[20] 

Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,

but those who plan peace have joy. 

[21] 

No ill befalls the righteous,

but the wicked are filled with trouble. 

[22] 

Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD,

but those who act faithfully are his delight.

Proverbs 11:2

[2] 

When pride comes, then comes disgrace,

but with the humble is wisdom.
