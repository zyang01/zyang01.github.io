It's not the time for memes, but I believe it conveys the idea of what I think will happen within two years. I know it's extremely cruel and dark, but I need to warn as many people as possible despite how unpleasant the process will be.

If you have programming experience, it took me max 2-3 hours to build the project [Bible Says Love](../on-cheating-bible-says-love){:target="_blank"} ([BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love){:target="_blank"}) and originally I was planning on paying a former colleague of mine to do the front end. Due to financial constraints, I had to do everything myself and I haven't done HTML and CSS for over half a decade. The project is running on Cloudflare Workers & Pages and it's just a simple backend that relays the incoming request to OpenAI‚Äôs API for processing using the GPT-4o model. I had zero experience working with either Cloudflare or OpenAI‚Äôs API before this and I barely had to look at their API documentation.

If you don't have programming experience, I asked a fellow computer scientist from KCL last night to guess how long it took me to build it. His guess was one week.

I spent most of the 2-3 hours fiddling with adjusting the user experience btw, the actual functionality was probably done in less than an hour.

I'm paying for the processing of the model out of my pocket to OpenAI. The cost of serving 1 million requests on [BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love){:target="_blank"} is less than a cup of coffee (¬£4/$5).

How long will it take your employer to figure out they could do everything you are doing right now with nearly zero cost and in seconds?

If your work is not [more complicated than aerodynamics](../on-aerodynamics){:target="_blank"}, then I believe you have less than 2 years.

Good luck, best wishes and God bless. üôè
