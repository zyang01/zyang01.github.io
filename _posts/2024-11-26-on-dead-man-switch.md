As alluded to in my previous post titled “On Fear”, if I stop meme posting online or my posts suddenly disappear, you know which embassies I may have walked into. 😉

Hebrews 2:14-15

[14] Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, [15] and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.

John 11:25-26

[25] Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, [26] and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?”

2 Corinthians 5:8

[8] Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

Psalm 23:4

[4] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

I will fear no evil,

for you are with me;

your rod and your staff,

they comfort me.

Have a go at me if you want, all are welcome. 🙏🫶😘

Edit: forgot about three hashtags.
