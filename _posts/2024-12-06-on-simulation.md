I think my atheist friend was pronounced dead at 6 AM UTC just now after the final nail in the coffin.

Edit: just realised this is way worse. Because the God in a simulated reality is deceiving and malicious, and intentionally messing with you. 😳😱💀

Proverbs 17:28

[28]

Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise;

when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent.

Psalm 14:1-6

The Fool Says, There Is No God

To the choirmaster. Of David.

[1] The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”

They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds;

there is none who does good.

[2] The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man,

to see if there are any who understand,

who seek after God.

[3] They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt;

there is none who does good,

not even one.

[4] Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers

who eat up my people as they eat bread

and do not call upon the LORD?

[5] There they are in great terror,

for God is with the generation of the righteous.

[6] You would shame the plans of the poor,

but the LORD is his refuge.
