Let me know if you are into drones, or know someone who does. ðŸ˜‰

I have a lab project in mind for my Boss. Might save some lives. ðŸ¥¹

Let me know if you are into drone laws as well. Wouldn't want to go against the wishes of my Boss and get punished severely. ðŸ˜³

Romans 13:1-7

Submission to the Authorities

[1] Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. [2] Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. [3] For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, [4] for he is Godâ€™s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out Godâ€™s wrath on the wrongdoer. [5] Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid Godâ€™s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. [6] For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. [7] Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.

Edit: I have a significantly lower cost solution figured out. ðŸŽˆ Although could still use a drone expert for a different scenario. ðŸ˜‰
