It seems the folks in ivory towers nowadays like to boast about the knowledge and wisdom they believe they have.

Although, most appear to believe in the “knowledge” and “wisdom” as written in books that are less sold, but automatically reject the teachings of mankind’s best-seller, which printed over 5 billion copies. The second best-seller is 1 billion copies.

Are they really wise? Or are they fools? 🤔

2 Peter 3:3-4

[3] knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. [4] They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.”

Matthew 24:10-12

[10] And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. [11] And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. [12] And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.

Proverbs 1:28-33

[28] Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;

they will seek me diligently but will not find me. 

[29] Because they hated knowledge

and did not choose the fear of the LORD, 

[30] would have none of my counsel

and despised all my reproof, 

[31] therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way,

and have their fill of their own devices. 

[32] For the simple are killed by their turning away,

and the complacency of fools destroys them; 

[33] but whoever listens to me will dwell secure

and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.”

2 Timothy 3:1-7

Godlessness in the Last Days

[1] But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. [2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5] having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. [6] For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, [7] always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
