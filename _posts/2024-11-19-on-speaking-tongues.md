I attended the evening gathering for 20s and 30s at IGC Burnt Oak last Wednesday. There were five of us and one of the attendees spoke in tongues half way through. It was the second time in my eight weeks as a believer and it was a personal message for me.

He sees me even in the parts that I hide away from myself, and nothing I do would make Him turn His back on me.

If I understood the message correctly, I think He gave me root permission? I still think Iâ€™m 100% human, so donâ€™t worry about that part. ðŸ™„

Edit: just a reminder that I didnâ€™t even trust myself for the first 27yrs of my life. I think He also wants me to trust myself and donâ€™t hold back like I used to? Believe it or not, I have held back my entire life. ðŸ¤”
