So, I was a bit tired after building the project [Bible Says Love](../on-cheating-bible-says-love){:target="_blank"} ([BibleSays.Love](https://biblesays.love){:target="_blank"}) and sending it out to a bunch of people I care about as an early Christmas present. I took a nap and woke up just now. I needed to reload on some Christian memes after the recent barrage of posts, so I went on Google Images to do that as usual and stumbled across a treasure trove about some German dude named [Martin Luther](https://buymeacoffee.com/aaronyangi/on-my-insanity){:target="_blank"}.

To be honest, despite the strong-worded posts I wrote, I have mainly been [stockpiling ammunition](../on-plausible-deniability){:target="_blank"} and still have doubts in my mind about how big I should go with the plans I have in mind. It's mostly just talk, and I haven't really done the walk.

Until I found out some German dude [nailed his Ninety-five Theses on the door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses){:target="_blank"} of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg, Germany on 31 October 1517, [started a legendary party known as the Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation){:target="_blank"}, and got excommunicated by the church in 1521.

I think I just got the final confirmation and sign-off from my Boss. And the answer to the question in my mind is go ham, till I get [excommunicated by the church or the human race](../on-choosing-sides){:target="_blank"}.

Time to [light some fig trees up](../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree){:target="_blank"} and blow some [drug addicts](../on-drug-money-addiction){:target="_blank"} in East London into the river Thames.

Let's party like it's 1517, shall we?

Acts 5:28-32

[28] saying, “We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.” [29] But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men. [30] The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. [31] God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. [32] And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”

Edit: update the title and add the missing hashtags.
