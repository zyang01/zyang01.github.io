Something to lighten up your day after the recent bombardment of heavy posts.

I had this revelation showing up in my head whilst I was in the shower a couple of days ago and I couldn’t stop laughing.

Some background context: I’m a massive poker degen and according to my poker tracker app, I have lost about £8,000 in the last 2yrs or so playing poker cash games. The craziest month was June 2022 and I played 23 sessions in total with the longest session lasting ~11hrs straight. I was coding a market making strategy whilst playing poker at the same time, and that’s when I learned to write #Rust. Got to make the money back somehow if I’m running a charity at the poker table right? 🤷

In hindsight, the big man probably liked my poker losing skills on my CV, and I can tell if the person I’m talking to believes me and how much they believe me by observing their body language and within a sentence or two. This came in quite handily when I was chasing Him around the world and breaking pastors (apologies to every pastor whose day I probably ruined in 10min convos 🙏).

Back to when I was in the shower couple days ago, the mental image of playing poker with an opponent sitting right across me at the top floor of the Hippodrome casino appeared in my head. Dude is holding a bible on His left hand and very casually flips the pages as He reads, and His facial expression changes as He reacts to the stories in the book. When the action is on Him, He casually looks at His hand, doesn’t even bother to cover it, casually picks up some chips, and bets as though He doesn’t have the slightest worry in the world. He then goes back to reading the bible, and doesn’t bat an eye on you the whole time. To my massive annoyance, dude wins every hand and He always show you His bluff after He gets away with it and collects His winnings happy as a child on Christmas Day. 🙄
