After 109 days of nonstop working, I have decided it’s time to go on holiday and get away from my new Boss for a bit.

I have also decided not to read mankind’s best seller when I'm bored. There's been enough scares since I got my first one end of July last year. It's better I don't know what's written on it after the incident earlier this week involving Isaiah 53. Almost pooped myself again today after finding out that Jonah and Isaiah are both popular in Judaism and Islam.

The setup for global extra potent salt sprinkling is almost complete. Once that's done I have got a couple of film castings to attend, an OnlyFans career to start and some lives to save before I'm forced to learn Hebrew.

My email is Jonah(at)HeSaid.Love if you wanna reach out.

See ya.
