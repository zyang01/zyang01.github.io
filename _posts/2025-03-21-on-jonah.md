I arrived half an hour early to meet my faithful new friend last Sunday morning. It was only fair because I missed several meetups by half an hour.

I was waiting outside London Bridge Station and had nothing to do. I started thinking about the Book of Jonah again. I want to call it my book, but that would be way too egotistical even for a delusional nutjob like me. I was thinking about Jonah's prayer in chapter 2, specifically the last verse.

## Jonah 2

Jonah’s Prayer

[1] Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, [2] saying,

 “I called out to the LORD, out of my distress,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he answered me;  
 out of the belly of Sheol I cried,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you heard my voice.  
 [3] For you cast me into the deep,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the heart of the seas,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the flood surrounded me;  
 all your breakers and your waves  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passed over me.  
 [4] Then I said, ‘I am driven away  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from your sight;  
 yet I shall again look  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon your holy temple.’  
 [5] The waters closed in over me to take my life;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the deep surrounded me;  
 weeds were wrapped about my head.  
 [6] To the roots of the mountains I went down,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.  
 Yet you brought up my life from the pit,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O LORD my God.  
 [7] When my life was fainting away,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered the LORD,  
 and my prayer came to you,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into your holy temple.  
 [8] Those who pay regard to vain idols  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forsake their hope of steadfast love.  
 **[9] But I with the voice of thanksgiving**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**will sacrifice to you;**  
 **what I have vowed I will pay.**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Salvation belongs to the LORD!”**  

 [10] And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. (ESV)

## Jonah 2:9 - Bible Hub

**But I, with the voice of thanksgiving,**  
Jonah's prayer from the belly of the fish marks a turning point in his spiritual journey. The "voice of thanksgiving" signifies a heart of gratitude despite dire circumstances. This reflects a common biblical theme where thanksgiving is offered in faith, even before deliverance is realized (Philippians 4:6). Jonah's gratitude foreshadows the New Testament teaching of giving thanks in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18).

**will sacrifice to You.**  
Sacrifice in the Old Testament often involved offerings at the temple, but here, Jonah speaks of a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (Hebrews 13:15). This indicates a shift from ritualistic practices to a more personal and heartfelt devotion. Jonah's commitment to sacrifice, even from within the fish, highlights the importance of internal worship over external rituals (Psalm 51:17).

**I will fulfill what I have vowed.**  
Vows in the ancient Near Eastern context were solemn promises made to God, often in times of distress, with the expectation of fulfillment upon deliverance (Ecclesiastes 5:4-5). Jonah's vow likely pertains to his prophetic mission to Nineveh, which he initially fled. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of faithfulness to one's promises to God (Numbers 30:2).

**Salvation is from the LORD!”**  
This declaration encapsulates the central theme of the Book of Jonah: God's sovereignty and mercy in salvation. It echoes the broader biblical narrative that salvation is not earned by human effort but is a divine gift (Ephesians 2:8-9). Jonah's acknowledgment prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan (Acts 4:12). This phrase also connects to the Psalms, where similar declarations of God's deliverance are made (Psalm 3:8).

I thought about my dire circumstances and hope for the Lord's deliverance. I realised my hypocrisy again. I did not sign up to be a believer expecting any good stuff, and He did not tell me there was any. I thought faith was my only reward, and I only learned about blessings through scripture and Pastor Eric's odd smile at the China Congregational Church in Hong Kong. Technically, the Lord delivered me already by saving my life last August. What more do I want than that?

Do I trust the Lord even before deliverance? Freaking yes. And absolutely. Do you?

I am extraordinarily annoyed at myself.
