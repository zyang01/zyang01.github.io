That's a false statement. There is right love and then there is wrong love. Wrong love is harm and not love. Giving into every unreasonable demand only promotes pride and haughtiness. Love needs discipline and restraint, otherwise it leads to destruction and indifference to others.

Speaking from personal experience, His love has not been wrong so far.

Proverbs 16:18

[18] Pride goes before destruction,

and a haughty spirit before a fall. (ESV)
