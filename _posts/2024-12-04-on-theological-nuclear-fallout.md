I dropped the theological nuke yesterday after a friend helped me build it. The detonation was codenamed Trinity for the Theological Manhattan Project. It was dropped on around two dozen people, mostly pastors and theologians I collected over the last 10 weeks and 4 days as a Christian intern. My atheist friend who helped me build it was the first victim and you can find his final moments in the screenshot below.

A mathematician friend asked me about the significance of the nuke. Unfortunately, it doesn't automatically give you a new life as a Christian, but it should give you an existential crisis if you are indeed a rational thinker as you proclaim yourself to be. Otherwise, you are just a hypocrite and can't even stand on reason anymore.

Essentially what the nuke implies is any rational argument you construct requires you to first believe the reality that you are constructing the argument in to be real, before you believe the argument to be true. And believing reality to be real is already a blind leap of faith that you took without knowing it's a blind leap of faith. If you deny you took that leap, then you have no claim to any statement you make of being true. Because then you are basically equating yourself to a brain in a jar, and everything you see, hear and feel is contained in a simulation, where no truth exists.

If you admit you took a blind leap of faith without knowing and believed in it all your life up to this point, is it really that difficult for you to take a leap of faith knowingly and believe the things written on mankind’s best seller? After all, you did believe the things written on less-sold books all your life with faith that you didn't know you had.

G-fucking-G folks. 🙏🫶😘

P.S. So far radio silence on most victims. Will wait for another 24-48 hours before I start filing missing person reports in multiple jurisdictions.

Edit: correct spelling.
