So, turns out most residential internet service providers (ISP) in the United Kingdom don't block ports that are commonly blocked by cloud providers. And you can get full fibre at gigabit speed that comes with a static IP address for less than 12 cups of coffee (£50/$63) a month.

I have got a ton of networking equipment and top-of-the-range UniFi access points left over from my gay/bi naturist camping days and three 1U servers lying around. Let me know if you would like a free Wi-Fi upgrade and signal optimisation at your London property on the condition that you allow me to [run an email server](../on-cloudflare){:target="_blank"}, which would also help me remotely diagnose any network issue you might encounter.

Christians only, no flaky unbelievers.

James 2:14-17

Faith Without Works Is Dead

[14] What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? [15] If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, [16] and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? [17] So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
