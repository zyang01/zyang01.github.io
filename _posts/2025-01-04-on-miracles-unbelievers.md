If you are an unbeliever and would like to see some proof before you decide whether God exists, then I suggest you find out what signs/wonders/miracles Jesus said He was going to give to an adulterous/unfaithful generation when they ask for one.

You might be able to find the answer in the Book of Matthew and the Book of Luke, both written nearly two thousand years ago now.

Once you find out what sign He said He was going to give, I suggest you look up that sign and decide for yourself if God exists. Shouldn't take you more than a day.
