Have a read on the following topics.

Solipsism.

Brain in a vat.

Epistemology.

First two chapters of Meditations on First Philosophy by René Descartes. The meditations employed skeptical methodic doubt and I believe they are the grand daddy of modern scientific methods.

Then let me know what can you know for absolute certainty about the reality that you’re perceiving, other than cogito, ergo sum (I think, therefore I am).

Edit: if you have to doubt, don’t do it half-assed, might as well doubt it all. 🙏🫶😘
