Did you know that out of the 44 colleges in Oxford University and 31 colleges in Cambridge University, only 1 college - Darwin College, Cambridge doesn’t have a chapel?

Mankind has had science for what? Three/four hundred years? What are the paintings and writings on the wall for all of the oxbridge “intellectuals” amongst my readers? Do you subscribe only to the works of the hall of fame listed in my previous post titled “On Science”, but not their believes? Are your pride and ego that majestic that you believe you know better than them now?

Maybe head to a church and think about it this weekend? 🤔

As always, be blessed and best wishes. 🙏🫶😘
