Hosea 4:1-2

The LORD Accuses Israel

[1] Hear the word of the LORD, O children of Israel,

for the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land.

There is no faithfulness or steadfast love,

and no knowledge of God in the land; 

[2] there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;

they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.

Revelation 21:8

[8] But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

There is also hope.

1 John 1:8-10

[8] If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

But at the end of the day, pun very much intended, do not put the Lord your God to the test. Otherwise, I think He might just show you His wrath if you so desperately want to see that. 🤔

As always, be blessed and best wishes. 🙏🫶😘
