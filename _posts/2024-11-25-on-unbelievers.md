May I ask what exactly is your problem with a world without tears, war, strife, pain and death?

As alluded to in my previous post titled ‚ÄúOn Scientific Materialism‚Äù, if you are indeed a rational thinker as you proclaim yourself to be, then I believe you should realise you cannot with absolute certainty say that the reality you are perceiving is real, rather than you being just a brain in a jar and some evil scientist is creating an entire simulation for you to live in. It requires faith for you to believe the reality you are seeing, hearing and feeling right now. You already had faith without realising it.

Why not just have a little bit more of that and see how you feel? Surely you can expend just a little bit more of that intellectual curiosity that you claim to possess? Or have you run out of that as well? ü§îüò≥üò±

Revelation 7:15-17

[15] ‚ÄúTherefore they are before the throne of God,

and serve him day and night in his temple;

and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.

[16] They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;

the sun shall not strike them,

nor any scorching heat.

[17] For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,

and he will guide them to springs of living water,

and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.‚Äù

Isaiah 11:6-9

[6] The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,

and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat,

and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together;

and a little child shall lead them.

[7] The cow and the bear shall graze;

their young shall lie down together;

and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

[8] The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra,

and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder‚Äôs den.

[9] They shall not hurt or destroy

in all my holy mountain;

for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD

as the waters cover the sea.

Hosea 2:18-20

[18] And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety. [19] And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. [20] I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the LORD.

Edit: if you are a believer or became a believer after reading my posts, could you do me a favour and share this with every unbeliever you know? I'm tired of screaming and shouting into the void and I believe Jesus said something about don't be ashamed of the gospel and whoever denies Him in front of others, He will deny them in front of the Father as well, or something like that. I'm tired and don't have the energy to check scripture right now. ü•≤
