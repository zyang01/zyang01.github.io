This is a summary post for the theological nuclear bomb that I believe proves faith precedes reason.

Pastor Xander from the Hong Kong Baptist Church informed me that I stand in the line of many church fathers: [Fides quaerens intellectum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fides_quaerens_intellectum){:target="_blank"}.

Q.E.D.

I'd like to give special thanks to Wealdstone Baptist Church, where I got the inspiration for the last piece I needed to finish building the theological nuclear bomb when I attended their Alpha night for the first time. They serve great food btw. I would also like to thank my atheist friend whose persistence challenged me to work out the argument. Rest in peace my friend, rest in peace. My apologies to everyone who I bombarded with messages and emails to forcefully solicit feedback. I know I'm a lot most of the time.

Lastly, thank you, my Lord. Thy will be done.
