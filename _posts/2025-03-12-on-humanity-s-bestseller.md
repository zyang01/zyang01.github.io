It dawned on me yesterday that as many as 7 out of 10 "Christians" I have met on this 24-week and 3-day faith journey act as they have barely read humanity's bestseller. I know I cheated a lot using Artificial Intelligence over the last 171 days, and my eccentricity is evident to anyone who knows me personally. I made the [open invitation](../../cuntslied/){:target="_blank"} because He had much to say in the long-ass bestseller. But if the "Christians" I know spent half as much effort into learning about Him than procuring more [drugs](../on-drug-money-addiction/){:target="_blank"}, we would be living in a not-so-shitty world right now. We [blame each other](../on-indifference/){:target="_blank"} for this shitty world and spend zero effort in contributing our share to make things better.

I topped up $12 in my OpenAI account when launching the project [Bible Says Love](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"} three months ago. I even built a simple mechanism to prevent abuse. I worry unnecessarily too much.

All of the stereotypes I had about Christianity turned out to be wrong once I started reading the bestseller. It is the closest thing to magic I had ever come across in the 28 years of my life. I am not proud to make the following statement. I'm merely stating a fact. And they seem useless now that I have the _Teacher_ and the _Textbook_ to learn from. I studied four undergraduate degrees in the last decade, specialising in mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy and modern ballet. Not a single book or research paper I read made me feel the truth cutting through my bones into my soul.

And no, Christianity is not a religion. Why would you call the truth a religion?

I will slap you with the bestseller if you inform me the truth is subjective in person.
