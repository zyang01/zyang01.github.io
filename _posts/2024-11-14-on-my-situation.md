Christian intern for 7 weeks and 4 days.

Tried to stop the book of revelation by taking a leap of faith in mainland China.

Chased Him around the world and overshot a bit to Rome, Italy for a fig tree.

Freaked a bunch of decade(s) long believers out along the way and ruined the day for a bunch of pastors.

Has contact to an underground Christian network in mainland China on Threema (Signal is not accessible in mainland China without VPN).

50+ posts on LinkedIn being salt of the earth.

1.5k post impressions per day on LinkedIn.

Bankrupt for 2 weeks and 3 days.

Rent is over a month overdue.

Put my younger sister through private school and UCL as an international student in London.

Put my younger brother through private school as an international student in London.

Paid for my great uncle’s funeral arrangement last year.

Bought my parents a new car before Chinese new year because the old car’s brakes didn’t really work.

Most of my six figure income friends and former colleagues don’t bother with a coffee after shoving them a mankind’s best seller.

Trying to get back on my feet and people keep slamming the door on my face.

I guess the lesson this time is not ask and ye shall receive, but rather I can only rely on the Lord since people’s hearts can be so cold that they won’t even spare a coffee when push comes to shove and after exposing all of my nakedness to the world. Turns out that’s how much my friendships and relationships are worth. Time to load up on more Christian memes I guess. 🤔

Edit: saw a complete stranger speak in tongues last night at IGC Burnt Oak and got a very heart warming message from my boss. Thanks, boss. 🙏🫶😘
