Judging by the lyrics, I think Boss Man is quite pissed off about [promiscuity](../on-pgp/){:target="_blank"}. 🤔

Isaiah 49:1-7

The Servant of the LORD

    [1] Listen to me, O coastlands,
        and give attention, you peoples from afar.
    The LORD called me from the womb,
        from the body of my mother he named my name. 
    [2] He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
        in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
    he made me a polished arrow;
        in his quiver he hid me away. 
    [3] And he said to me, “You are my servant,
        Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” 
    [4] But I said, “I have labored in vain;
        I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
    yet surely my right is with the LORD,
        and my recompense with my God.”

    [5] And now the LORD says,
        he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
    to bring Jacob back to him;
        and that Israel might be gathered to him—
    for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD,
        and my God has become my strength—
    [6] he says:
    “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
        to raise up the tribes of Jacob
        and to bring back the preserved of Israel;
    I will make you as a light for the nations,
        that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”

    [7] Thus says the LORD,
        the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,
    to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation,
        the servant of rulers:
    “Kings shall see and arise;
        princes, and they shall prostrate themselves;
    because of the LORD, who is faithful,
        the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
