When I was still exploring my faith (100% God but 95% Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour), I found discussions online speculating that the apostles and the various characters in the bible were potentially schizophrenic or had other severe types of mental illness according to modern psychology. My mental health was/is also questioned by almost everyone whose not a believer in my life.

I brought the following question to my Christ bro therapist. If God does indeed exist, do you think God is right and everyone in the bible is fine, or is modern psychology right in that everyone in the bible had some sort of mental illness and God is wrong? Basically, are we right or is God right? I think you can take a guess on which answer we settled on between two Christ bros.

Did you know that there is an entire category of counsellors/psychologists for Christians? Apparently it‚Äôs a thing nowadays since people just think you have gone nuts once you start talking about God as described in mankind‚Äôs best seller. ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑

I don‚Äôt see people react like you‚Äôre crazy when you talk about ‚Äúscience‚Äù as described in lesser sold books.

I do wonder if my boss comes back tomorrow, what would people think of His mental health. ü§î

Q.E.D.
