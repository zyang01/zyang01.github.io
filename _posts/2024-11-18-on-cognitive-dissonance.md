A quick reminder of what cognitive dissonance is via a quote from Wikipedia, since a friend wasn’t sure. 😉

Festinger explains avoiding cognitive dissonance as, "Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point."

If you are in a state of disbelief after reading all of my posts, and couldn’t quite come up with an explanation to help you fathom what exactly is going on, then I believe you are experiencing cognitive dissonance.

Feel free to reach out, I know a guy who has an entire team that could help. 🙏🫶😘

Don’t suffer in silence. 😘
