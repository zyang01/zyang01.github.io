title: On Great British Weather

After the recent tirades of kicking, screaming and shouting, I have decided it's time to go on a retreat and enjoy some great British weather in the winter. I'm also physically exhausted after multiple trips of international travels.

I haven't danced or enjoyed creating any artwork since moving back to London two years ago and starting my first full-time job at a former employer. So I seized the opportunity to exercise my creativity and ordered a windbreak with a custom design.

However, due to financial constraints, I won't be able to go anywhere fancy or travel luxuriously like I used to. So central London will have to do and you might be able to find me in a square near Tottenham Court Road station enjoying some downtime and reading mankind’s best seller. Feel free to come over, say hi and maybe buy an amateur WhatsApp philosopher a coffee.

Hope you enjoy the custom design. Steak is on da house this winter. 🙏🫶😘

Time to dust off some camping gear from my gay/bi naturist camping days. 🫨

[22] So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.

Isaiah 40:31

[31] but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength;

they shall mount up with wings like eagles;

they shall run and not be weary;

they shall walk and not faint.

Exodus 14:13

[13] And Moses said to the people, “Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.
