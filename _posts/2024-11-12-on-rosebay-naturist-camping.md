In hindsight, I realised this is what truly happened at the campsite. One thing that I found rather shocking was how everyone was extremely nice in front of each other, but secretly hate each other to the guts and the amount of gossip that goes around was insane.

Romans 1:26-32

[26] For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; [27] and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.

[28] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. [29] They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, [30] slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, [31] foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. [32] Though they know Godâ€™s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
