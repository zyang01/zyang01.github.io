If you got here discreetly via a new project I started recently, then I have a couple of messages for you from my Boss and me personally.

My Boss wants you to know that people fucked up. They forgot love should be above all else, and He sees all the shame, humiliation and everything that you went through simply because of how He created you. He wants to take away the shame and humiliation and wipe away your tears if you give Him a chance.

He told me to reach out to you and gather the rebels. He’s coming back.

We are running out of time. Listen to the music.

Joshua 2:1-7

Rahab Hides the Spies

[1] And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab and lodged there. [2] And it was told to the king of Jericho, “Behold, men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.” [3] Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.” [4] But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. And she said, “True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. [5] And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.” [6] But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof. [7] So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. And the gate was shut as soon as the pursuers had gone out.

Hebrews 11:31

[31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
