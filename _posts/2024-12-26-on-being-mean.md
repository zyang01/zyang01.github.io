Didn’t realise I can be a mean son of a man sometimes. Don’t worry, according to 23andMe, I'm 100% Chinese. However, they did [discipline me with the rod of men by bearing false witness last week](../on-humble-pie){:target="_blank"} and [sent two dozen Holy Bibles to destruction in Belfast](../on-beef){:target="_blank"}.

Once I have the [email infrastructure set up and start delivering warning letters](../on-thou-shalt-send-it){:target="_blank"}, ma [beef recipe](../on-great-british-weather){:target="_blank"} is gonna be real famous. Just repent please sister. 🙏🫶😘

Ephesians 4:32

[32] Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
