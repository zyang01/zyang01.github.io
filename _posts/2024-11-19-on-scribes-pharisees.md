Often times, I saw more faith in the eyes of common people who make up the congregations than the people who lead them. This is especially bad in Europe. Things are better in the states, and the faith in Asia is incredible. IMHO, European churches are mostly rich on the outside, but faithfully bankrupt on the inside.

1 Corinthians 1:26-29

[26] For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. [27] But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; [28] God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, [29] so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.

Luke 12:35-40

You Must Be Ready

[35] “Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, [36] and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks. [37] Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them. [38] If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants! [39] But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. [40] You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”

Edit: if we have met in person, then I can smell your faithfulness from your body language without you uttering a single word. If we have exchanged messages online, I can read your faithfulness between the lines. I would like to remind everyone that no one knows that day or that hour. Be blessed and good luck. 🙏
