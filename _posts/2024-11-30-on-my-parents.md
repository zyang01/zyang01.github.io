It’s a bit weird. Even at the lowest point of my life, being bankrupt, unemployed and would appreciate a little bit of love and care, they couldn't seem to be satisfied by my testimony and the fact that I'm worry-free and content like a five-year-old every day because of the love and care He’s giving me.

My mom was furious after finding out I bought a drone to spread the gospel and accused me of failing everyone who's ever helped me and asked me to think about what I did wrong.

Sounds like I must have failed catastrophically in life and was a gigantic disappointment to everyone. Both of my parents told me to wake the fuck up after stabbing me with vicious words. To be honest, I would rather keep dreaming about His love than wake up to the kind of love my parents have for me. Although I'm not so sure this is a dream.

Regardless, I'm sorry Mom and Dad, my life is His and not yours nor mine now. I remain forever grateful for your love and care in the first 27 years of my life, whether you believe it or not. 🙏

Proverbs 18:21

[21] 

Death and life are in the power of the tongue,

and those who love it will eat its fruits.

Ephesians 4:29

[29] Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.

James 3:6-10

[6] And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell. [7] For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, [8] but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. [9] With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. [10] From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
