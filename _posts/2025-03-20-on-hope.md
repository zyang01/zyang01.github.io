It dawned on me that you need to have faith to have hope when I was gorging on spicy noodles in London Chinatown earlier. Technically speaking, hope is delusional because you do not know if things will turn out okay. You believe things will be okay despite the lack of evidence, especially when things are on fire. You need faith to believe and hope when everything is against you.

If you like to doubt, then I would like to remind you that there is a non-zero probability that you could [have a stroke or heart attack tonight](https://www.wsj.com/story/should-you-worry-about-dying-in-your-sleep-19861c91){:target="_blank"}. There is [no guarantee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_arrhythmic_death_syndrome){:target="_blank"} that you will wake up tomorrow.

I was smiling like an absolute psycho on my way home. I found myself doing that a lot lately when thinking about Boss Man's love. I thank Him after an effortless number two nowadays.

Enjoy.

## 1 Peter 3:8–22

Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake

[8] Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. [9] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. [10] For

 “Whoever desires to love life  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and see good days,  
 let him keep his tongue from evil  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his lips from speaking deceit;  
 [11] let him turn away from evil and do good;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him seek peace and pursue it.  
 [12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his ears are open to their prayer.  
 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”  

 [13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.

[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
