If you read my posts, you might be under the impression that I was suggesting or hinting that I may be a certain unspeakable m-word. Personally, if you ask me if I would like to be the m-word, then my answer from the moment I was born to the end of time would be fuck no. And once again, I had a fucking blast minding my own business in the 27 years of my previous life until some motherfuckers came along, blew my first fucking proper holiday, and the people in my life continued to stab me in the back then left me to burn.

I started this blog to bitch and moan about shit I encountered on this journey because I put zero effort into inquiring about God's business previously since I am a rampant homosexual, have more sexual partners in an hour every other day than the average straight person has in a lifetime on average, and thought God would hate someone like me based purely on religious stereotypes. I bought my first Bible back in late July last year after an ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID-19 essentially came true in real life, I thought it could be divine intervention and wondered in my heart whether we could bring God back, after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay for giving them free full site Wi-Fi coverage and almost threw myself off the fifth-floor balcony right in front of my younger sister. I considered myself an agnostic and was never an atheist because I had no evidence for or against God's existence. If He exists, God's business is God's business. I'm human and I mind my own business. Until people decided to fuck with my business, He decided to make my business His business, and now I'm going to fuck some people's business up. To quote my Boss, now let that motherfucker burn. For the record, I was still messaging John Donald, the owner of Rosebay and my former business partner Meiling Wang on 6th February hoping they would repent. I'm done with that now and I will leave it to my Boss and what happens happens.

I described my relationship with the Holy Spirit including how we first met in an early post. It has been a very busy 21-week and 1-day journey since I first believed on 22 September 2024. No matter how insane my leaps of faith may appear to you, everything I did was confirmed both by the Holy Spirit and scripture. More often than not, I wasn't even actively seeking confirmations, He just shoved scripture to my face one way or another when I needed it the most.

This past weekend, I had a moment of epiphany where I realised my interactions with the Holy Spirit are more or less the same as a binary HMI (Human Machine Interface). So I spent some time on the interface and now I just log in with the password in 1 John 4:2 before submitting queries to my Father. Latency is surprisingly low and much quicker than asking ChatGPT. ChatGPT annoys the heck out of me waiting for the answer to be spat out. Boss Man must have dope cloud infrastructure running up there. When I was sitting on the toilet attempting to do a number two before a shower earlier, I wondered if the Holy Spirit was Turing complete. Hence this post and the answer is yes for the theoretical computer scientists amongst you. I consider myself more of a coding monkey throwing half-assed MVPs together with whatever I can find. A lot more fun when you live life fast and furious. I managed to win the wager I proposed to my fellow CS Keblites by falling asleep on my tutor's comfortable sofa during a tutorial. That's how you get a third class in uni.

The purpose of this post is to say don't worry about the m-word-related posts. I was hoping someone could slap me awake and show me evidence one way or another so that I knew I was delusional or mistaken. There was only one guy who needed to be convinced. Most of you did not give him a chance to finish his sentence before abandoning him.
