If you attended the 2018 Keble Ball and you had pizza, then you are more than welcome, and please try not to fuck things up if you are running for office or plan to run in the future.

If you did not attend the 2018 Keble Ball, then I just want to apologise for feeding potentially up to 1,500 pretentious Oxford grads when they were young, stupid and drunk during a summer night back in 2018. I was punished severely the following morning and got a hangover for the first time in my life. I was also craving badly for fish.
