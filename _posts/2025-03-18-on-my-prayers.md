I thought it would be fun to share some of my prayers and reasons for them. If you are a believer, enjoy.

Let me suffer because we are forgetful. I don't want to forget His saving grace and become an ungrateful bastard.

Let me save some people, including rampant homosexuals, because I love them.

Teach me to have faith strong enough to walk on water. It sounds super fun. Jesus and Peter did it.

Give me strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. I needed that due to what happened.

Guide the people I know or meet back to Him, show them His light, and give them strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. It's a good thing, and why not?

Give people I know or meet the Holy Spirit. It gets annoying when people think you are insane.

Let me die. Asked for that a bunch of times because people in my life have been really faithful.

Help me forgive because I really could not.

Thank Him because He was good to me in the first 27 years of my life even when I did not know Him. Not to mention He literally saved my life last year.

Let me rest because I have been working my ass off, and some people blew my first proper holiday.
