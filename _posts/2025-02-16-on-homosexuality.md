**What about Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.**

---

Leviticus 18:22

[22] You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (ESV)

---

Leviticus 20:13

[13] If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. (ESV)

---

**Judging by your commitment to Mosaic Law, you must be a faithful Israelite, a scarce find throughout history. I want to bring your attention to the following passages in Leviticus and please do let me know in advance when you plan on rounding up unbelievers and reinstating the death penalty.**

---

Leviticus 20:10

Punishments for Sexual Immorality

[10] “If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. (ESV)

---

Leviticus 24:16

[16] Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. (ESV)

---

Leviticus 20:27

[27] “A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.” (ESV)

---

**If you are a "follower" of Jesus asking about Leviticus, I want to bring your attention to the following passages. Please do get in touch so that I can personally visit your humble abode and marvel at your magnificence if you have never told a lie before.**

---

Leviticus 19:11

[11] “You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; you shall not lie to one another. (ESV)

---

Romans 2:1

God’s Righteous Judgment

[1] Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. (ESV)

---

Romans 2:17–24

[17] But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God [18] and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; [19] and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, [20] an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—[21] you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? [22] You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? [23] You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. [24] For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.” (ESV)

---

Matthew 23:13

[13] “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. (ESV)

---

**If you still want to ask about 1 Corinthians 6:9 or 1 Timothy 1:9 after the above, then I suspect you failed not only maths and sciences but also reading comprehension in school. Your teacher should have taught you to read the fucking context you fucking moron. Are you clean enough to single my community out and judge by labelling us an abomination and shutting the kingdom of heaven in our faces when we seek Him?**

---

1 Corinthians 6:9–11

[9] Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, [10] nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. [11] And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. (ESV)

---

1 Timothy 1:8–11

[8] Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, [9] understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, [10] the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, [11] in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. (ESV)

**If you are a faithful Israelite mentioned above, I would love to practice throwing stones at some blasphemous false teachers together once you have brought Mosaic Law and the death penalty back. I will go happily and willingly to meet my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ after the false teachers as a rampant homosexual, a regular at Horse Fair by Jamie HP, FickstutenMarkt in Berlin, and Lab.oratory in the basement of Berghain.**
