It's the last night of my trip to Russia today and I will be travelling back to the U.K. tomorrow. Before my arrival in Moscow, I thought I was here to look into Russian Orthodox Churches and He wanted to show me divisions in the church (1 Corinthians 1:10-17). I asked a former colleague of mine who's British Korean and also a Christian for church recommendations considering the weekend was imminent. He recommended St Andrew's Anglican Church, Moscow and I went to their Remembrance Sunday service today.

I cried at the end of the service when they read out the quote below by John Maxwell Edmonds from the service pamphlet.

> When you go home, tell them of us and say
>
> For their tomorrow, we gave our today.

I thought at the end of my global tour that my calling was to bring Him back. After the service today, I realised it's not just Jesus who gave His life for our sins, servicemen and servicewomen also gave their lives for our sins, and I'm going to bring them back too.

When God's Kingdom comes back, all the money you make and have today, will be as good as toilet paper. It will be a Kingdom where money and capitalism are things of the past and there will be no more sorrow and no more tears. You mark my words on that.

For Love and Devotion.
