title: Reasoning Behind Going to Rome for the Fig Tree

Back when I was in the great US of A during my global tour, I received the instruction to burn down the fig tree via the song ‚ÄúAnd We Danced‚Äù by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. The instruction was confirmed by the Holy Spirit.

I subsequently discussed the possibility of doing so with a couple of friends I trust, presenting the idea as a joke. My mind was full of doubt thinking how could that even be remotely possible considering the securities that would no doubt be around the gigantic fig tree in Rome. Then one day I was listening to 1 Corinthians using the ESV app on my phone and heard the following verse.

1 Corinthians 1:27

[27] But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;

Now, suppose I‚Äôm a satirical movie script writer and I would like to write a John Wick-style story, but with the protagonist being a nerdy 27yo who's not gotten into a physical altercation since puberty and he's tasked with infiltrating a hostile nation and take down their government. Wouldn't it be funny if somehow the main character just waltzes into the main government building with zero preparation and somehow succeeds?

I believe the King of Drama could certainly write a script like that. ü§î

On an unrelated note, I had a call with my missionary guide based in mainland China after I arrived in NYC and consulted his opinion on Catholicism. He informed me that the reformed churches were born out of the roman catholic church during the Reformation.

I was also looking for a church to attend the upcoming Sunday service when I was in NYC. I stayed with a Chinese high school friend who works in NYC and He managed to lead me to a reformed church nearby when the area was full of fig trees, being northeast US and all.

And the sermon that Sunday?

Mark 11:12-14

Jesus Curses the Fig Tree

[12] On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. [13] And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. [14] And he said to it, ‚ÄúMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.‚Äù And his disciples heard it.

The moment I read ‚Äúfor it was not the season for figs‚Äù, I was hit by a lightning bolt.

Why on earth would I understand some random line on mankind‚Äôs best seller the first time I read about it and it somehow removed all the doubt in my mind??? ü§∑

I sent Binding of Issac (Genesis 22) to my friends who were understandably concerned. I wanted them to know that I have faith in God‚Äôs righteousness and He won't let me do anything stupid or unrighteous, but at the end of the day, my obedience precedes all else, including my own needs and advice from people I trust in life.

Hence, I seek advice from people, but I only seek guidance from Him. My global tour was my oath of allegiance.

Edit: spelling.
