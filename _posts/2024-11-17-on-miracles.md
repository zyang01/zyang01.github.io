So, according to Google, there are 2.38 billion Christians in the world, out of a global population of 8 billion.

Basically, over 2 billion people right now believe some Dude died and resurrected some 2000 years ago based on mankindâ€™s best seller which printed over 5 billion copies.

I would call that a pretty big fucking miracle if there ever was one. ðŸ˜±

Edit: just a quick reminder, He made a believer as insane as me in 8 weeks and I went preaching in mainland China Jonah style less than 2 weeks after believing in Him. For those of you who know me personally in my old life, surely that counts as a bloody miracle?
