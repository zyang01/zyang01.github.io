This is largely from memory. I have heard the theory that we tend to remember bad things than good things in psychology, so take this with a grain of salt, no pun intended.

My dad seemed to be mostly absent due to business trips. He's a former quarter billionaire and provided a decent amount of material support growing up, so I'm grateful for that and his absence is understandable. We can't have it all, it wouldn't be fair.

My mom took very good care of me and attended to my every need when it came to things that she considered beneficial to my academic learning. My only complaint is she never bought me any toys, or at least I don't remember any. And whatever toys or games my grandparents and great-uncle bought me were met with disappointment from her. I have a space behind my drawers to hide them from her.

Matthew 18:10

The Parable of the Lost Sheep

[10] “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.

Proverbs 1:8-9

The Enticement of Sinners

[8] Hear, my son, your father’s instruction,

and forsake not your mother’s teaching,

[9] for they are a graceful garland for your head

and pendants for your neck.

Matthew 18:2-4

[2] And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them [3] and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. [4] Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

Mark 10:14-16

[14] But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. [15] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” [16] And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.

Edit: just realised according to scripture, I’m in possession of the golden ticket for entry to heaven. 😱😱😱 Not to mention He’s also giving me the childhood I thought I was missing. Thanks Boss. 🙏🫶😘😘😘😘😘
