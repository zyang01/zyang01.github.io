Originally, I wrote another long-winded draft on seggs referencing all sorts of relevant passages I found using AI. As a massive lazy ass like Jonah, I didn't even get through half of the passages returned by OpenAI before deciding not to bother. If you **DID NOT FAIL** logical reasoning **AND** reading comprehension in school, then you could cheat with AI like using [this tool](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"} that I built using ChatGPT or train a LLM if you are a nerd like me, and then carefully reason about whether the Lord would be okay for you to try the creative activity you have in mind that might involve your and hopefully your partner's no-go areas. I devised two lazy rules to clock out early from Boss Man. Dude's been nagging me since Hong Kong back in October, but to be fair I would probably continue sitting on my [get-out-of-jail-free card](../on-background-music/){:target="_blank"} for a couple of months if He didn't start nagging me since then.

Rule 1: Love always comes first which means the creative activity should be giving rather than taking in nature, and the answer is **NO** if the activity has a non-zero probability of giving you even the slightest idea (Matthew 5:27-30) of taking from or exploiting other people.

Rule 2: Lust which focuses on self-gratification and taking is a gigantic **NO-NO**.

Rule 1 + Rule 2 = Don't be [a cunt](../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt){:target="_blank"}.

This is ChatGPT explaining it and my sexual theologian job title lasted just over 24 hours.

The easiest is to ask our Heavenly Father for the Holy Spirit and get to know Him. Double check with the Holy Spirit whether what you have in mind is acceptable using the [Holy Spirit Positive-Only HMI](../on-positive-only-hmi/){:target="_blank"}. I asked the Holy Spirit if I could refer to Him as the Spiritual Condom. I don't think Bro's a big fan of that so nvm.

Below is the **extremely NSFW** director cut of my [~~New Year~~](../on-sacrifice/){:target="_blank"} New Millennium present, and a boring example of love rather than lust. I read the Book of Hebrews yesterday. The Hall of Faith in Hebrews was too interesting. I thought that having something I believed in and was willing to die for, was in [itself a big enough reward](../on-suffering/){:target="_blank"} already after not believing even myself for my entire life. I had no idea there were blessings until my third sermon at China Congregational Church, Hong Kong that weekend and the pastor smiled and only responded that there would be blessings to come, after I went 6,000 miles in 5 minutes as usual. I was wondering what he was smiling about. I got annoyed again earlier this evening.
