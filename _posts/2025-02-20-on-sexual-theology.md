Originally, I wrote another long-winded draft on seggs referencing all sorts of relevant passages I found using AI. As a massive lazy ass like Jonah, I didn't even get through half of the passages returned by OpenAI before deciding not to bother. If you **DID NOT FAIL** logical reasoning **AND** reading comprehension in school, then you could cheat with AI like using [this tool](https://biblesays.love/){:target="_blank"} that I built using ChatGPT or train a LLM if you are a nerd like me, and then carefully reason about whether the Lord would be okay for you to try the creative activity you have in mind that might involve your and hopefully your partner's no-go areas. I devised two lazy rules to clock out early from Boss Man. Dude's been nagging me since Hong Kong back in October, but to be fair I would probably continue sitting on my [get-out-of-jail-free card](../on-background-music/){:target="_blank"} for a couple of months if He didn't start nagging me since then.

Rule 1: Love always comes first which means the creative activity should be giving rather than taking in nature, and the answer is **NO** if the activity has a non-zero probability of giving you even the slightest idea (Matthew 5:27-30) of taking from or exploiting other people.

Rule 2: Lust which focuses on self-gratification and taking is a gigantic **NO-NO**.

Rule 1 + Rule 2 = Don't be [a cunt](../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt){:target="_blank"}.

This is ChatGPT explaining it and my sexual theologian job title lasted just over 24 hours.

The easiest is to ask our Heavenly Father for the Holy Spirit and get to know Him. Double check with the Holy Spirit whether what you have in mind is acceptable using the [Holy Spirit Positive-Only HMI](../on-positive-only-hmi/){:target="_blank"}. I asked the Holy Spirit if I could refer to Him as the Spiritual Condom. I don't think Bro's a big fan of that so nvm.

Below is the **extremely NSFW** director cut of my [~~New Year~~](../on-sacrifice/){:target="_blank"} New Millennium present, and a boring example of love rather than lust. I read the Book of Hebrews yesterday. The Hall of Faith in Hebrews was too interesting. I thought that having something I believed in and was willing to die for, was in [itself a big enough reward](../on-suffering/){:target="_blank"} already after not believing even myself for my entire life. I had no idea there were blessings until my third sermon at China Congregational Church, Hong Kong that weekend and the pastor smiled and only responded that there would be blessings to come, after I went 6,000 miles in 5 minutes as usual. I was wondering what he was smiling about. I got annoyed again earlier this evening.

Edit: before you lean on your own understanding and accuse me of being demon-possessed, I would encourage you to contemplate why a sexually promiscuous person like me who has more sexual partners in an hour every other day than the average heterosexual has in their lifetime and thought God would hate someone like me for 27 years of my former life, could feel His love even before I received my first Holy Bible and was willing to take a bullet for any stranger walking past me [that evening](../on-love/){:target="_blank"}. Not to mention the leap of faith I subsequently took in mainland China after He came to save me in late August last year, you are also more than welcome to read about the countless number of occasions where I almost pooped my pants after finding out I had been fulfilling prophecies unknowingly. Don't worry about my salvation. I don't. I suggest you focus on your own salvation and perhaps spend some time worrying about humanity's salvation if you could graciously take time away from your comfy sofa.

Matthew 12:22–32

Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit

[22] Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. [23] And all the people were amazed, and said, “Can this be the Son of David?” [24] But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.” [25] Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. [26] And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? [27] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. [28] But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. [29] Or how can someone enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. [30] Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. [31] Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. [32] And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. (ESV)
