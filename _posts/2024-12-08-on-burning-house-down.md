Burn the House Down - Song by AJR

Used to keep it cool

Used to be a fool

All about the bounce in my step

Watch it on the news

Whatcha gonna do?

I could hit refresh and forget

Used to keep it cool

Should I keep it light?

Stay out of the fight?

No one's gonna listen to me

If I write a song

Preaching what is wrong

Will they let me sing on TV?

Should I keep it light?

Is that right?

Way up way up we go

Been up and down that road

Way up way up, oh no

We gon' burn the whole house down

Watch me stand in the line

You're only serving lies

You've got something to hide

We gon' burn the whole house down

We gon' burn the whole house down

Yeah, used to let it go

Walk into the show

Gawking at the tricks up your sleeve

Too good to be true

But I'm in a room

Full of entertainers and thieves

Used to let it go

Woah, oh no

(Woah, oh no)

Way up way up we go

Been up and down that road

Way up way up, oh no

We gon' burn the whole house down

Watch me stand in the line

You're only serving lies

You've got something to hide

We gon' burn the whole house down

We gon' burn the whole house down

Should I hang my head low?

Should I bite my tongue?

Or should I march with every stranger

From Twitter to get shit done?

Used to hang my head low

Now I hear it loud

Every stranger from Twitter is gonna burn this down

Way up way up we go

Been up and down that road

Way up way up, oh no

We gon' burn the whole house down

Watch me stand in the line (whoa oh)

You're only serving lies (yeah)

You've got something to hide

We gon' burn the whole house down

Woah oh, yeah

We gon' burn the whole house down

We burn it down, we burn it down

We gon' burn the whole house down

*a kind reminder once again. You are either with us, or you are against us. Good luck on that day. 🙏🫶😘
