After the successful theological nuclear detonation on Tuesday codenamed Trinity, part of the Theological Manhattan Project, two nuclear bombs codenamed Little Boy and Fat Man were dropped on 65 theologians and 587 philosophers/mathematicians/physicists from Oxford, Cambridge, and KCL. Their email addresses were scraped using some Python scripts from the respective department websites.

Email read receipts are in three digits and so far I have only received one reply from a Dr Modest from the philosophy department at KCL exactly 13 minutes and 54 seconds after Fat Man was dropped, informing me that I have made a mistake somewhere and unfortunately no one amongst his esteemed colleagues will have the time to correct an amateur like me. Dr Modest also suggested I should perhaps be more intellectually modest, learn from others, and get my work published in a serious journal first before he could modestly accommodate a modest conversation with me. I intend to follow his modest advice modestly, after all, I dropped out of my physics and philosophy undergraduate degree at KCL after merely one term, who am I to disagree with a modest scholar such as Dr Modest who has a PhD from the University of Geneva?

I timed myself reading my not-so-modest email and the three posts linked in the email and it took just over 7 minutes in total. Dr Modest must be a really fast reader and thinker to immediately spot the amateur error I made. Although, I'm slightly puzzled as to why Dr Modest didn't modestly point out the amateur error that I made, but instead had the time to come up with the adjective “I-ve-just-shown-every-expert-is-wrong-what-do-you-think” to describe my email. He also modestly informed me that there's no need to reply since he won’t take the modest time to modestly read my email given his modest schedule.

Ivy League next then.

Proverbs 12:17-18

[17] 

Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence,

but a false witness utters deceit. 

[18] 

There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,

but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
