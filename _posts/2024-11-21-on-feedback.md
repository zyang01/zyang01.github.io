There were a lot of times in the last couple months I felt like I was drowning in this world, because no matter how loud I scream, and how much I write, I rarely get any feedback from people, especially from people I know in real life.

From time to time, I get a message or two from people telling me that they have read my posts. Even just a few simple words would often make my day. They tell me that not all of my efforts have gone down the drain. I know I write a lot and I seem to have a fair bit to say, but I don’t want to feel like I have lost the entire world and no one gets me anymore.

Luckily, I know He gets me and He definitely reads everything, including my heart. 🙏🫶😘

Matthew 13:3-9

[3] And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. [5] Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, [6] but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. [7] Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. [8] Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [9] He who has ears, let him hear.”

1 Corinthians 3:5-9

[5] What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. [6] I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. [7] So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. [8] He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. [9] For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s field, God’s building.

I guess I need to be patient and let my Boss do the growing then. 🫠🙄🥲
