During the early phase of exploring my faith and back when I could still afford Uber, I had discussions about God with at least half of the Uber drivers I encountered.

I learned a great deal about Christianity, Islam and Buddism, and exchanged phone numbers with a handful of them. I believe He probably sent them to educate me on the subject of faith when I was running around like a headless chicken as you could probably get the impression from the 176 posts I have written so far on this 11-week and 3-day journey.

I learned of the fact that the Quran was passed down by memory through the generations and therefore has the property of an immutable distributed ledger with sharding using human memory. You will know what I'm on about if you're a crypto bro, otherwise, have a read about blockchain technology on Wikipedia. I was also surprised by the countless versions of the Holy Bible and wondered which one I should choose, but my main concern was how would I know if a certain version correctly reflects the original meaning of God’s Word. As a bilingual speaker, I know that lost in translation is a real thing, and I did consider learning Hebrew at one point, but it's not currently on my to-do list due to my laziness.

I have also purchased and seen/read more than half a dozen different versions of the Holy Bible now in English and Simplified/Traditional Chinese. One common phrase left a strong impression in my mind whilst reading the foreword/introduction of all these different Bible versions.

This Holy Bible has been faithfully translated.

I realised if I were to have faith and believe in an almighty God. Then I would choose the God whose Word can be preserved through faith and faith alone rather than through a human invention and rely on human memory.
