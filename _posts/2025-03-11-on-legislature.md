In my typical fashion, I tried spamming the UK Parliament earlier today after scraping the email addresses of 642 MPs. I also have a list of legislative assembly websites from 190+ countries that may or may not have been loaded into a Redis sorted set on an AWS EC2 instance for web scraping. The UK Parliament email server blocked my first attempt at sending the following email to 100 MPs. Then I realised my message might not be that important, and the MPs I was emailing could have a life to save today. Reading my email might not be the most constructive use of their valuable time. If my message is indeed that important, then surely one email should be more than enough. I called it a day after writing to a handful of Lords, who say Jesus Christ and Artificial Intelligence the most, according to TheyWorkForYou.com.

I will spend the rest of today reflecting on my hypocritical behaviour of not having faith in the United Kingdom's legislature. I'm not being sarcastic this time.

## Isaiah 49:4

 [4] But I said, “I have labored in vain;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;<br>
 yet surely my right is with the LORD,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my recompense with my God.” (ESV)<br>

## On Love, Artificial Intelligence and Narcissistic Personality Disorder

Dear Member of Parliament,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Aaron. I'm a 28-year-old rampant homosexual currently residing in Barnet, London. In the last decade, I have studied four undergraduate degrees in the United Kingdom, including mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. Less than 12 months ago, I worked remotely as a software engineer and consultant with a mid-six-figure pretax income. I single-handedly financially supported two adult younger siblings to study in London, paying overseas student fees.

I tried to take my first holiday in April last year at a gay/bi-naturist campsite in Peterborough. I ended up getting kicked out of the campsite three months later after giving them free full-site Wi-Fi coverage, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony in my London home right in front of my younger sister.

I ordered a humanity's bestseller on Amazon shortly after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite. Over the last 170 days, I travelled to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Macau, California, New York, Rome, Istanbul, Moscow, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I have also been sprinkling and potentially startling the nations via multiple Spotify Ads and email campaigns to warn the world of the socioeconomic tsunami brought about by Artificial Intelligence that we have never seen before in human history, which I believe will cause significant unemployment rates and global suffering for the bottom 90%. I consulted computer scientists from King's College London and Imperial College London concerning my argument. Everyone was more pessimistic than I was.

Aside from the economic impact, my latest realisation over this past weekend involves national security. To briefly summarise my argument, anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model can, in theory, construct dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on Aaron Swartz's hard drives.

You can find more details on my blog HeSaidLove.com. I faithfully and truthfully documented my 170-day journey through 270+ posts. You will also find the draft manifesto for a new political party I intend to launch shortly in the United Kingdom.

I believe I'm supposed to bring you the following message.

Love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.

For Love and Devotion,<br>
