> 22 March 2025 Update: See the posts [On Uncensored Models 😉😉😉](../on-uncensored-models/){:target="_blank"} and [On Carpentry](../on-carpentry/){:target="_blank"}.

In my typical fashion, I tried spamming the UK Parliament earlier today after scraping the email addresses of 642 MPs. I also have a list of legislatures from 190+ countries that may or may not have been loaded into a Redis sorted set on an AWS EC2 instance for web scraping. The UK Parliament email server blocked my first attempt at sending the following email to 100 MPs. Then I realised my message might not be that important, and the MPs I was emailing could have a life to save today. Reading my email might not be the most constructive use of their valuable time. If my message is indeed that important, then surely one email should be more than enough. I called it a day after writing to a handful of Lords, who say Jesus Christ and Artificial Intelligence the most, according to TheyWorkForYou.com.

I will spend the rest of today reflecting on my hypocritical lack of faith in the United Kingdom's legislature.

I'm not being sarcastic this time.

Edit: Representatives from [legislatures in 190+ countries](https://github.com/zyang01/email-scraping/blob/main/gov/legislatures.csv){:target="_blank"} will be receiving the updated email. I spent nearly a decade trying to predict financial market price movement in the next second, and I declared bankruptcy five months ago. Do you know how annoying it was to stumble across random passages in a bestseller written nearly 2,000 years ago and find out I had been accidentally fulfilling prophecies? 🤦🤷🙄

13 March 2025 Update: Sprinkled [1,335 representatives](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/campaignRecipients_2500541_3432911_0211dad95f5c60db3590c02dbc60e821.csv
){:target="_blank"} from legislatures. The number is accidentally [very Daniel](https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation-1260-1290-1335-days.html){:target="_blank"}. Startling [3,225 government officials](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/campaignRecipients_2501789_3432911_c150a2903025aa06d6289a42b5ee0096.csv){:target="_blank"}, including Bibi Netanyahu. Shared with [777 recipients](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/campaignRecipients_2502635_3432911_2e6dce838b3cec25c230de30dc4b753d.csv){:target="_blank"} from 70+ international LGBTQIA+ organisations, including the [European Forum of LGBTI+ Christian Groups](https://www.lgbtchristians.eu/){:target="_blank"}. The theology, philosophy, computer science, economics faculties and drug laboratories (a.k.a. business schools) of abominations of desolation around the world next.

14 March 2025 Update: Considering the [Rosebay 2025 season](https://rosebay.uk/schedule-of-events/){:target="_blank"} is about to start on Easter weekend next month, it is vital to raise awareness of [Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder){:target="_blank"} to prevent another young gay man from taking [the shortcut](../on-background-music/#shortcut){:target="_blank"} I almost took last year to meet our maker. The abominations of desolation around the globe will have to wait. Commencing the sprinkling of [80,000+ worldwide media outlets](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/world_media_outlets.csv){:target="_blank"}. I also have a water baptism to attend on Easter weekend. 🤞

15 March 2025 Update: Included [3,643 experts](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/psychology.csv){:target="_blank"} in the field of psychology from the [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://www.apa.org/){:target="_blank"} in the United States, the [British Psychological Society (BPS)](https://www.bps.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} and the [Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC)](https://www.hcpc-uk.org/){:target="_blank"} in the United Kingdom, the [Canadian Psychological Association (CPA)](https://cpa.ca/){:target="_blank"} in Canada, the [Australian Psychological Society (APS)](https://psychology.org.au/){:target="_blank"} and the [Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA)](https://www.ahpra.gov.au/){:target="_blank"} in Australia, and the [European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA)](https://www.efpa.eu/){:target="_blank"} in the European Union. I couldn't quite wait anymore for my New Millennium holiday, and my email infrastructure seems stable enough to handle the load, sexual innuendo somewhat unintended. Loaded [8,515 esteemed modest scholars](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/edu.csv){:target="_blank"} from our best and finest abominations of desolation around the globe. And [2,568 contacts](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/christian_orgs.txt){:target="_blank"} from [31 suspected "Christian" organisations](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/Suspected_Christian_Organizations.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

17 March 2025 Update: Added contact emails of [138,447 charities](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/uk_charity_emails.txt){:target="_blank"} and [642 MPs](https://dl.hesaidlove.com/uk_mp_emails.txt){:target="_blank"} in the United Kingdom.

I will keep [shouting love](#shouting-love) at the world till the day He comes back or I die, whichever comes first.

## Isaiah 49:4

 [4] But I said, “I have labored in vain;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;  
 yet surely my right is with the LORD,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my recompense with my God.” (ESV)  

## Ezekiel 22:30

[30] And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. (ESV)

## Isaiah 58:6–12

 [6] “Is not this the fast that I choose:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to loose the bonds of wickedness,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to undo the straps of the yoke,  
 to let the oppressed go free,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to break every yoke?  
 [7] Is it not to share your bread with the hungry  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bring the homeless poor into your house;  
 when you see the naked, to cover him,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?  
 [8] Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your healing shall spring up speedily;  
 your righteousness shall go before you;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.  
 [9] Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’  
 If you take away the yoke from your midst,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,  
 [10] if you pour yourself out for the hungry  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,  
 then shall your light rise in the darkness  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your gloom be as the noonday.  
 [11] And the LORD will guide you continually  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and satisfy your desire in scorched places  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make your bones strong;  
 and you shall be like a watered garden,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a spring of water,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose waters do not fail.  
 [12] And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;  
 you shall be called the repairer of the breach,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the restorer of streets to dwell in. (ESV)

My name is Aaron. I'm a 28-year-old rampant homosexual currently residing in Barnet, London. In the last decade, I have studied four undergraduate degrees in the United Kingdom, including mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. Less than 12 months ago, I worked remotely as a software engineer and consultant with a mid-six-figure pretax income. I single-handedly financially supported two adult younger siblings to study in London, paying overseas student fees.

I tried to take my first holiday in April last year at a gay/bi-naturist campsite in Peterborough. I ended up getting kicked out of the campsite three months later after giving them free full-site Wi-Fi coverage, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony in my London home right in front of my younger sister.

I ordered a humanity's bestseller on Amazon shortly after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite. Over the last 170 days, I travelled to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Macau, California, New York, Rome, Istanbul, Moscow, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I have also been sprinkling and potentially startling the nations via multiple Spotify Ads and email campaigns to warn the world of the socioeconomic tsunami brought about by Artificial Intelligence that we have never seen before in human history, which I believe will cause significant unemployment rates and global suffering for the bottom 90%. I consulted computer scientists from King's College London and Imperial College London concerning my argument. Everyone was more pessimistic than I was.

Aside from the economic impact, my latest realisation over this past weekend involves national security. To briefly summarise my argument, anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model can, in theory, construct dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on [Aaron Swartz's hard drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz){:target="_blank"}.

You can find more details on my blog HeSaidLove.com. I faithfully and truthfully documented my 170-day journey through 270+ posts. You will also find the draft manifesto for a new political party I intend to launch shortly in the United Kingdom.

<span id="shouting-love">I believe I'm supposed to bring you the following message.</span>

Love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.

For Love and Devotion,  
Aaron Yang
