In my typical fashion, I tried spamming the UK Parliament earlier today after scraping the email addresses of 642 MPs. I also have a list of legislatures from 190+ countries that may or may not have been loaded into a Redis sorted set on an AWS EC2 instance for web scraping. The UK Parliament email server blocked my first attempt at sending the following email to 100 MPs. Then I realised my message might not be that important, and the MPs I was emailing could have a life to save today. Reading my email might not be the most constructive use of their valuable time. If my message is indeed that important, then surely one email should be more than enough. I called it a day after writing to a handful of Lords, who say Jesus Christ and Artificial Intelligence the most, according to TheyWorkForYou.com.

I will spend the rest of today reflecting on my hypocritical behaviour of not having faith in the United Kingdom's legislature.

I'm not being sarcastic this time.

Edit: Representatives from [legislatures in 190+ countries](https://github.com/zyang01/email-scraping/blob/main/gov/legislatures.csv){:target="_blank"} will be receiving the updated email. I spent nearly a decade trying to predict financial market price movement in the next second, and I declared bankruptcy five months ago. Do you know how annoying it was to stumble across random passages in a bestseller written nearly 2,000 years ago and find out I had been accidentally fulfilling prophecies? 🤦🤷🙄

13 March 2025 Update: Sprinkled [1,335 representatives](https://dl.hesaid.love/campaignRecipients_2500541_3432911_0211dad95f5c60db3590c02dbc60e821.csv
){:target="_blank"} from legislatures. The number is accidentally [very Daniel](https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation-1260-1290-1335-days.html){:target="_blank"}. Startling [3,225 government officials](https://dl.hesaid.love/campaignRecipients_2501789_3432911_c150a2903025aa06d6289a42b5ee0096.csv){:target="_blank"}, including Bibi Netanyahu. Shared with [777 recipients](https://dl.hesaid.love/campaignRecipients_2502635_3432911_2e6dce838b3cec25c230de30dc4b753d.csv){:target="_blank"} from 70+ international LGBTQIA+ organisations, including the [European Forum of LGBTI+ Christian Groups](https://www.lgbtchristians.eu/){:target="_blank"}. The theology, philosophy, computer science, economics faculties and drug laboratories (a.k.a. business schools) of abominations of desolation around the world next.

14 March 2025 Update: Considering the [Rosebay 2025 season](https://rosebay.uk/schedule-of-events/){:target="_blank"} is about to start on Easter weekend next month, it is vital to raise awareness of [Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder){:target="_blank"} to prevent another young gay man from taking [the shortcut](../on-background-music/#shortcut){:target="_blank"} I almost took last year to meet our maker. The abominations of desolation around the globe will have to wait. Commencing the sprinkling of [80,000+ worldwide media outlets](https://dl.hesaid.love/world_media_outlets.csv){:target="_blank"}. I also have a water baptism to attend on Easter weekend. 🤞

I will keep [shouting love](#shouting-love) at the world till the day He comes back or I die, whichever comes first.

## Isaiah 49:4

 [4] But I said, “I have labored in vain;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;<br>
 yet surely my right is with the LORD,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my recompense with my God.” (ESV)<br>

## Matthew 24:1–2

Jesus Foretells Destruction of the Temple

[1] Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. [2] But he answered them, “You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” (ESV)

## Mark 12:41–44

The Widow’s Offering

[41] And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. [42] And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. [43] And he called his disciples to him and said to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. [44] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.” (ESV)

## Mark 13:1–2

Jesus Foretells Destruction of the Temple

[1] And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!” [2] And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” (ESV)

## Luke 21:1–6

The Widow’s Offering

[1] Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, [2] and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. [3] And he said, “Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. [4] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.”

Jesus Foretells Destruction of the Temple

[5] And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said, [6] “As for these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” (ESV)

My name is Aaron. I'm a 28-year-old rampant homosexual currently residing in Barnet, London. In the last decade, I have studied four undergraduate degrees in the United Kingdom, including mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. Less than 12 months ago, I worked remotely as a software engineer and consultant with a mid-six-figure pretax income. I single-handedly financially supported two adult younger siblings to study in London, paying overseas student fees.

I tried to take my first holiday in April last year at a gay/bi-naturist campsite in Peterborough. I ended up getting kicked out of the campsite three months later after giving them free full-site Wi-Fi coverage, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony in my London home right in front of my younger sister.

I ordered a humanity's bestseller on Amazon shortly after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite. Over the last 170 days, I travelled to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Macau, California, New York, Rome, Istanbul, Moscow, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I have also been sprinkling and potentially startling the nations via multiple Spotify Ads and email campaigns to warn the world of the socioeconomic tsunami brought about by Artificial Intelligence that we have never seen before in human history, which I believe will cause significant unemployment rates and global suffering for the bottom 90%. I consulted computer scientists from King's College London and Imperial College London concerning my argument. Everyone was more pessimistic than I was.

Aside from the economic impact, my latest realisation over this past weekend involves national security. To briefly summarise my argument, anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model can, in theory, construct dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on [Aaron Swartz's hard drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz){:target="_blank"}.

You can find more details on my blog HeSaidLove.com. I faithfully and truthfully documented my 170-day journey through 270+ posts. You will also find the draft manifesto for a new political party I intend to launch shortly in the United Kingdom.

<span id="shouting-love">I believe I'm supposed to bring you the following message.</span>

Love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.

For Love and Devotion,<br>
