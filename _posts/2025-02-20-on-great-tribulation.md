Edit: [in case](https://dl.hesaid.love/1335_Days_and_Tribulation.pdf){:target="_blank"} you are so fucking stupid and ignorant to not know you are losing your job within 2 years if you don't have a degree more complicated than computer science.

See ya on judgement day. Might be a good idea to get Amazon Prime. 🙏😅😂

Just a quick reminder in case some stupid cunts want to try some idiotic shit. Ask yourselves if you know how to spell Boss Man's name first. I would advise you to save it, but sometimes you simply cannot stop stupid fucking cunts.

## Isaiah 61 <br><br> The Year of the LORD’s Favor

```none

[1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
    because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor;
    he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
    and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
[2] to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor,
    and the day of vengeance of our God;
    to comfort all who mourn;
[3] to grant to those who mourn in Zion—
    to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,
the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
    the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;
that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
    the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
[4] They shall build up the ancient ruins;
    they shall raise up the former devastations;
they shall repair the ruined cities,
    the devastations of many generations.


[5] Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;
    foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
[6] but you shall be called the priests of the LORD;
    they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;
you shall eat the wealth of the nations,
    and in their glory you shall boast.
[7] Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;
    instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;
therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion;
    they shall have everlasting joy.


[8] For I the LORD love justice;
    I hate robbery and wrong;
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
    and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
[9] Their offspring shall be known among the nations,
    and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;
all who see them shall acknowledge them,
    that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.


[10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;
    my soul shall exult in my God,
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;
    he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,
    and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
[11] For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,
    and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
    to sprout up before all the nations. (ESV)
