**Edit 2: I realised my language doesn't necessarily encourage people to keep on reading, but I said truth over appearances at the beginning since the world has gotten way too fake. So I'm just going to sincerely apologise here once again after the hundreds of apologies I have already made. I genuinely believe you will understand my use of language if you finish reading. Thanks.**

Edit 3: I just realised something quite unfortunate that I never understood before in The Final Judgement. I had always wondered why repeated the same pattern in Matthew 25:44 given the same was said in more detail through Matthew 25:37-39, and **why would they not recognise the Lord when they believed they knew the Lord**. I think they are there through cumbersome elaborateness to make me realise the scribes and Pharisees who did not bother to look into the evidence before referring me to mental health services are exactly the ones who won't recognise the Lord. **I'm not saying I'm the Lord, I'm saying they never knew the Lord in the first place and if they would not allow someone like me to even present the evidence that I have encountered the Lord, how could they possibly recognise the Lord when He comes back?**

**This is first-degree self-deception caught in the act, unfortunately. Karma is a bitch, but I sincerely hope I'm not the fucking messiah for their sake and there is still time for them to repent.**

Matthew 25:31‚Äì46

The Final Judgment

[31] ‚ÄúWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [34] Then the King will say to those on his right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.‚Äô [37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?‚Äô [40] And the King will answer them, ‚ÄòTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.‚Äô

[41] ‚ÄúThen he will say to those on his left, ‚ÄòDepart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.‚Äô [44] Then they also will answer, saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?‚Äô [45] Then he will answer them, saying, ‚ÄòTruly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.‚Äô [46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.‚Äù (ESV)

Edit 1: in case you are so fucking stupid and ignorant to not know [you are losing your job within 2 years](https://letter.hesaid.love/){:target="_blank"} if you don't have a degree more complicated than computer science, you can read my lazy-ass research using ChatGPT [here](https://dl.hesaid.love/1335_Days_and_Tribulation.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to ignore if you are in the top 1%, otherwise let's see if the people telling you not to worry will help you when shit hits the fan and whether they stand to gain or lose from your downfall and stupidity.

See ya on judgement day. Might be a good idea to get [Amazon Prime](https://www.gotquestions.org/famine-hearing-words-Lord.html){:target="_blank"}. üôèüòÖüòÇ

Just a quick reminder in case some stupid cunts want to try some idiotic shit. Ask yourselves if you know how to spell Boss Man's name first. I would advise you to save it, but sometimes you simply cannot stop stupid fucking cunts. [Kill shot only](../on-overemployment){:target="_blank"} otherwise I personally guarantee you will be more thoroughly fucked than [this](../on-sexual-theology/){:target="_blank"}.

## Abomination of Desolation on July 1999

Halfway through the 1,260 + [1,260 + 30 + 45](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+12/){:target="_blank"} weeks.

I arrived at the gay/bi-naturist Rosebay campsite 45 weeks ago.

In case you didn't get it, [higher education](../on-he-as-aod/){:target="_blank"} is full of spiritually desolate late-teenage to early-twenties [nihilists](../on-we-all-die/){:target="_blank"}/[anarchists](../on-indifference/){:target="_blank"} with [drug addictions](../on-drug-money-addiction/){:target="_blank"} and they can [neither reason nor read](../on-faith-precedes-reason/){:target="_blank"}. Institutions proclaiming to dedicate their time and resources to the truth are interested in nothing other than more drugs (a.k.a. money and business schools), the school of philosophy has already fallen under the four horsemen existentialism, nihilism, antinatalism and death as always, and the [stupid mother fucking egomaniacs](../on-faith-precedes-reason/){:target="_blank"} hiding behind jargon and publications have the mother fucking audacity to compare theology with the study of unicorns and fairytales.

I found the gentleman and the abomination above via the [World Science Forum](https://worldscienceforum.org/){:target="_blank"}. I learned most of my quantum physics and relevant epistemological/philosophical knowledge by watching their videos on YouTube during COVID-19. All of my subsequent thinking and reasoning concerning existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism can all be attributed back to them. **The only way I found to overcome the terminal illness of nihilism is by voluntarily taking up your cross (responsibilities) and following Him. Otherwise, whether I choose to throw myself out of the balcony today is as meaningless as whether I choose to pick up a knife and stab someone as long as I can get away with it under the law.**

I found the 46-page manifesto in the UNESCO Digital Library above via [the history page of the World Science Forum](https://worldscienceforum.org/contents/history-of-world-science-forum-110010){:target="_blank"}. The impression I got after quickly scrolling through the document was it made a ton of bold claims on ethics and essentially by saying scientific knowledge alone can bring good to humanity. The only thing it left out? God. Do we know how to spell good and evil? I don't know.

I found a certain gentleman who may or may not have been mentioned in this post and he dedicated rather generously his time and effort to the various scientific organisations behind the scenes, which I found to be rather interesting for a direct descendent of a well-known figure who allegedly was a prophet and messenger of God, but I couldn't seem to find the name in humanity's bestseller, which I consider to be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The gentleman certainly has an appetite to cross fields including politics. Kinda like me, but I'm confident my fellow pretentious Oxford alumni are more than capable of fucking the world up and it would be wise to dedicate my time instead to futile pursuits such as salvation.

**And no, I'm not the fucking messiah. I'm just a servant running around preparing the homecoming party for Boss Man.** Although, I genuinely don't know what some self-proclaimed Christians are thinking most of the time. Throughout this journey, I wanted nothing other than someone to slap me the fuck awake with the annoyingly thick humanity's bestseller, they did everything including referring me to mental health services and suggesting I must be an egomaniac **except** looking at the evidence I was serving up on a platter and reason with me. None of them reply to my messages and emails anymore.

I wonder if they truly want the messiah or not, and why the fuck is everyone just sitting around waiting for the one fucking messiah? Do you know how big of a fucking job that is for Boss Man and how much did each of us contribute after 2,000 fucking years? If I was in Boss Man's shoes then I would rather just let this fucking wicked world burn while I Netflix and chill than save a bunch of lazy ass mother fuckers who neither reason nor read.

How about you do your part, I do mine, Boss Man does His and let's find out on the other side what we are?

Happy New Millennium if you are not [an unfaithful motherfucking cunt](../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt){:target="_blank"} **AND** most importantly not a self-proclaimed "believer" who doesn't want Boss Man to come back.

## [Rivers - Song by Thomas Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqYEvGr372M){:target="_blank"}

We're like rivers in the night<br>
I go left and you go right<br>
We'll find out on the other side<br>
Who we are, who we are<br>
Wish me luck and give me hope<br>
Give me sunlight to my day<br>
Turn it into gold<br>
Carry on, carry on<br>

We'll take these broken souls<br>
Make them as good as new<br>
Bind it together into something we could never lose<br>
We're rivers in the night<br>
I go left and you go right<br>
We'll find out on the other side<br>
Who we are, who we are<br>

We can make it onto something beautiful<br>
Yeah, we don't have to try<br>
We can make it into something wonderful<br>
We'll never say goodbye<br>

## Isaiah 61 <br><br> The Year of the LORD‚Äôs Favor

```none

[1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
    because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor;
    he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
    and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
[2] to proclaim the year of the LORD‚Äôs favor,
    and the day of vengeance of our God;
    to comfort all who mourn;
[3] to grant to those who mourn in Zion‚Äî
    to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,
the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
    the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;
that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
    the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
[4] They shall build up the ancient ruins;
    they shall raise up the former devastations;
they shall repair the ruined cities,
    the devastations of many generations.


[5] Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;
    foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
[6] but you shall be called the priests of the LORD;
    they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;
you shall eat the wealth of the nations,
    and in their glory you shall boast.
[7] Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;
    instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;
therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion;
    they shall have everlasting joy.


[8] For I the LORD love justice;
    I hate robbery and wrong;
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
    and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
[9] Their offspring shall be known among the nations,
    and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;
all who see them shall acknowledge them,
    that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.


[10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;
    my soul shall exult in my God,
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;
    he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,
    and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
[11] For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,
    and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
    to sprout up before all the nations. (ESV)
