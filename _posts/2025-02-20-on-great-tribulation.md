### Edit 5

This post is to announce the end of the great tribulation. And to proclaim the Day of the Lord and the year of the Lord‚Äôs favour as described in humanity‚Äôs bestseller the Holy Bible. Unlike most people, I did not trust myself even once in the last 28 years of my life. Yet, I stand by every single word I wrote down in all blog posts in accurately expressing the sentiment and the severity of the situations, no matter how ridiculous, ugly, profane or even blasphemous you might find my language in your measurement.

I have read less than 25% of the Holy Bible and I believe you can resolve the questions you might have regarding my posts using only the Holy Bible. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm telling the truth. I believe I‚Äôm telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to a degree that I as a mere mortal human being am capable of grasping. If you are unable to clarify any questions you have, ask our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, don‚Äôt ask me. I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt lean on my own understanding. I found the best choice. I trust my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and that‚Äôs more than sufficient for me, even if that means I will stand trial in front of God almighty, burn in hell for eternity and be condemned by every single human being on this earth. I believe I have a clear conscience in front of God. I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt need to know. I have confirmation from the Holy Spirit and will happily accept whatever judgment He has for me.

My question for you is this. Can you bear to finish reading my posts before you come up with your own judgment and inform me about your opinion, or simply give up? My educated guess is those who can are few. You don't need to reply. This is not about me. This is about your salvation and between you and Him.

Matthew 7:13‚Äì14

[13] ‚ÄúEnter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. [14] For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)

P.S. This edit was originally for the mistake I found when going back to cross-check the things I wrote in this post, given how outrageous the claims I'm making are. The mistake I found is pretty big. The videos I watched during COVID-19 to learn about quantum physics and relevant epistemological/philosophical arguments that inspired my subsequent thinking in existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism are in fact from the World Science Festival rather than World Science Forum. I must jumped after my findings and didn't realise this WSF is not that WSF. YouTube will show me the World Science Festival if I search World Science Forum. I thought about whether I should correct that and asked the Holy Spirit. I remembered this passage from the legendary Mr Noisy Gong.

Romans 8:26‚Äì30

[26] Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. [27] And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. [28] And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. [29] For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. [30] And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)

However, the mistake is so big and embarrassing that Mr Noisy Gong, a.k.a. Apostle Paul's words are not enough. So here is my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ with a tiny shove by Spotify.

Matthew 19:26

[26] But Jesus looked at them and said, ‚ÄúWith man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.‚Äù (ESV)

I decided not to worry about it and go play. I think it's fair to say I have worried enough for everyone now and some people can take some responsibilities and worry for themselves. They don't seem to spend much time worrying for others anyway. I don't know what they do all day, to be honest, other than taking selfies.

### Edit 2

**I realised my language doesn't necessarily encourage people to keep on reading, but I said truth over appearances at the beginning since the world has gotten way too fake. So I'm just going to sincerely apologise here once again after the hundreds of apologies I have already made. I genuinely believe you will understand my use of language if you finish reading. Thanks.**

### Edit 3

I just realised something quite unfortunate that I never understood before in The Final Judgement. I had always wondered why repeated the same pattern in Matthew 25:44 given the same was said in more detail through Matthew 25:37-39, and **why would they not recognise the Lord when they believed they knew the Lord**. I think they are there through cumbersome elaborateness to make me realise the scribes and Pharisees who did not bother to look into the evidence before referring me to mental health services are exactly the ones who won't recognise the Lord. **I'm not saying I'm the Lord, I'm saying they never knew the Lord in the first place and if they would not allow someone like me to even present the evidence that I have encountered the Lord, how could they possibly recognise the Lord when He comes back?**

**This is first-degree self-deception caught in the act, unfortunately. Karma is a bitch, but I sincerely hope I'm not the fucking messiah for their fucking sake and there is still time for them to repent.**

**Will you believe me when I say I never wanted to be the fucking messiah now?**

Matthew 25:31‚Äì46

The Final Judgment

[31] ‚ÄúWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [34] Then the King will say to those on his right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.‚Äô [37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?‚Äô [40] And the King will answer them, ‚ÄòTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.‚Äô

[41] ‚ÄúThen he will say to those on his left, ‚ÄòDepart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.‚Äô [44] Then they also will answer, saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?‚Äô [45] Then he will answer them, saying, ‚ÄòTruly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.‚Äô [46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.‚Äù (ESV)

### Edit 4

[Fuck me](https://dl.hesaid.love/love_not_lust.mp4){:target="_blank"}. I just realised the implications of what I had just proved in Edit 3. Now I find [Malachi 3:1 even more annoying](../on-background-music/#malachi-3-1){:target="_blank"} and have zero desire to laugh. It does not feel great when you find out you are the fool all along, right? ü§°

Since we have announced the **year of the Lord's favour** below, might as well do the **Day of the Lord** together. I seem to always run ahead of Boss Man and keep tripping over. I thought the Day of the Lord was why He told me to go to Israel last month. You can find out what happened by looking up the relevant posts yourself and I'm going to stop putting effort into hyperlinking everything. It takes a fuck ton of effort and barely anyone read my posts if I didn't sprinkle the nations to shove my posts to your fucking faces. And the fucking scribes and Pharisees did not [fucking bother to reply](https://dl.hesaid.love/scribes_and_pharisees.pdf){:target="_blank"} to any single fucking email other than the first couple fucking courtesy responses.

You can find out what happens on the day yourself and for the first time in my life, I think I'm seriously going to not bother this time and you can all go fuck yourselves. I thought Malachi 3:2 might not mean what people think they mean when I read it last month in Israel. The only thing I have left to say is Dude's math is confusing AF and I technically dropped out of my maths and CS degree after only one term so I know dick about math either. I know dick about how long the Day of the Lord is, could be one day, one week, one month or one year, but I suspect it won't be longer than one year otherwise why have the Day of the Lord and the year of the Lord's favour? You will know what I'm on about if you seriously tried reading humanity's bestseller before. Ask Boss Man if you really wanna know, I'm not gonna bother and I'm certain I will have at least 10x more fun watching people get what they deserve while getting surprised by the King of Drama and Horror, wouldn't you agree? I think it's called justice and righteousness and I hope that's how you spell them since I haven't seen those two words for a while now. Just need to find a couple of faithful new friends, never bold enough to watch horror movies myself and ideally they have a comfy sofa I can crash on.

If you are a faithful believer, then congratulations. Happy New Millennium and you are more than welcome.

If you are [an unfaithful motherfucking cunt](../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt){:target="_blank"}, [go fuck yourself](https://dl.hesaid.love/love_not_lust.mp4){:target="_blank"}. üñï

I'm gonna Bible and chill. Have read probably less than 25% of the thick-ass bestseller. Only flipped through Genesis and up to Exodus 10ish one evening late last year out of the 5 books of The Law.

### Edit 1

In case you are so fucking stupid and ignorant to not know [you are losing your job within 2 years](https://letter.hesaid.love/){:target="_blank"} if you don't have a degree more complicated than computer science, you can read my lazy-ass research using ChatGPT [here](https://dl.hesaid.love/1335_Days_and_Tribulation.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to ignore if you are in the top 1%, otherwise let's see if the people telling you not to worry will help you when shit hits the fan and whether they stand to gain or lose from your downfall and stupidity.

See ya on judgement day. Might be a good idea to get [Amazon Prime](https://www.gotquestions.org/famine-hearing-words-Lord.html){:target="_blank"}. üôèüòÖüòÇ

Just a quick reminder in case some stupid cunts want to try some idiotic shit. Ask yourselves if you know how to spell Boss Man's name first. I would advise you to save it, but sometimes you simply cannot stop stupid fucking cunts. [Kill shot only](../on-overemployment){:target="_blank"} otherwise I personally guarantee you will be more thoroughly fucked than [this](../on-sexual-theology/){:target="_blank"}.

I arrived at the gay/bi-naturist Rosebay campsite 45 weeks ago.

In case you didn't get it, [higher education](../on-he-as-aod/){:target="_blank"} is full of spiritually desolate late-teenage to early-twenties [nihilists](../on-we-all-die/){:target="_blank"}/[anarchists](../on-indifference/){:target="_blank"} with [drug addictions](../on-drug-money-addiction/){:target="_blank"} and they can [neither reason nor read](../on-faith-precedes-reason/){:target="_blank"}. Institutions proclaiming to dedicate their time and resources to the truth are interested in nothing other than more drugs (a.k.a. money and business schools), the school of philosophy has already fallen under the four horsemen existentialism, nihilism, antinatalism and death as always, and the [stupid mother fucking egomaniacs](../on-faith-precedes-reason/){:target="_blank"} hiding behind jargon and publications have the mother fucking audacity to compare theology with the study of unicorns and fairytales.

I found the gentleman and the abomination above via the [World Science Forum](https://worldscienceforum.org/){:target="_blank"}. I learned most of my quantum physics and relevant epistemological/philosophical knowledge by watching their videos on YouTube during COVID-19. All of my subsequent thinking and reasoning concerning existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism can all be attributed back to them. **The only way I found to overcome the terminal illness of nihilism is by voluntarily taking up your cross (responsibilities) and following Him. Otherwise, whether I choose to throw myself out of the balcony today is as meaningless as whether I choose to pick up a knife and stab someone as long as I can get away with it under the law.**

I found the 46-page manifesto in the UNESCO Digital Library above via [the history page of the World Science Forum](https://worldscienceforum.org/contents/history-of-world-science-forum-110010){:target="_blank"}. The impression I got after quickly scrolling through the document was it made a ton of bold claims on ethics and essentially by saying scientific knowledge alone can bring good to humanity. The only thing it left out? God. Do we know how to spell good and evil? I don't know.

I found a certain gentleman who may or may not have been mentioned in this post and he dedicated rather generously his time and effort to the various scientific organisations behind the scenes, which I found to be rather interesting for a direct descendent of a well-known figure who allegedly was a prophet and messenger of God, but I couldn't seem to find the name in humanity's bestseller, which I consider to be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The gentleman certainly has an appetite to cross fields including politics. Kinda like me, but I'm confident my fellow pretentious Oxford alumni are more than capable of fucking the world up and it would be wise to dedicate my time instead to futile pursuits such as salvation.

**And no, I'm not the fucking messiah. I'm just a servant running around preparing the homecoming party for Boss Man.** Although, I genuinely don't know what some self-proclaimed Christians are thinking most of the time. Throughout this journey, I wanted nothing other than someone to slap me the fuck awake with the annoyingly thick humanity's bestseller, they did everything including referring me to mental health services and suggesting I must be an egomaniac **except** looking at the evidence I was serving up on a platter and reason with me. None of them reply to my messages and emails anymore.

I wonder if they truly want the messiah or not, and why the fuck is everyone just sitting around waiting for the one fucking messiah? Do you know how big of a fucking job that is for Boss Man and how much did each of us contribute after 2,000 fucking years? If I was in Boss Man's shoes then I would rather just let this fucking wicked world burn while I Netflix and chill than save a bunch of lazy ass mother fuckers who neither reason nor read.

How about you do your part, I do mine, Boss Man does His and let's find out on the other side what we are?

Happy New Millennium if you are not [an unfaithful motherfucking cunt](../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt){:target="_blank"} **AND** most importantly not a self-proclaimed "believer" who doesn't want Boss Man to come back.

## [Rivers - Song by Thomas Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqYEvGr372M){:target="_blank"}

We're like rivers in the night<br>
I go left and you go right<br>
We'll find out on the other side<br>
Who we are, who we are<br>
Wish me luck and give me hope<br>
Give me sunlight to my day<br>
Turn it into gold<br>
Carry on, carry on<br>

We'll take these broken souls<br>
Make them as good as new<br>
Bind it together into something we could never lose<br>
We're rivers in the night<br>
I go left and you go right<br>
We'll find out on the other side<br>
Who we are, who we are<br>

We can make it onto something beautiful<br>
Yeah, we don't have to try<br>
We can make it into something wonderful<br>
We'll never say goodbye<br>

## Isaiah 61 <br><br> The Year of the LORD‚Äôs Favor

```none

[1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
    because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor;
    he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
    and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
[2] to proclaim the year of the LORD‚Äôs favor,
    and the day of vengeance of our God;
    to comfort all who mourn;
[3] to grant to those who mourn in Zion‚Äî
    to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,
the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
    the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;
that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
    the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
[4] They shall build up the ancient ruins;
    they shall raise up the former devastations;
they shall repair the ruined cities,
    the devastations of many generations.


[5] Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;
    foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
[6] but you shall be called the priests of the LORD;
    they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;
you shall eat the wealth of the nations,
    and in their glory you shall boast.
[7] Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;
    instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;
therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion;
    they shall have everlasting joy.


[8] For I the LORD love justice;
    I hate robbery and wrong;
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
    and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
[9] Their offspring shall be known among the nations,
    and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;
all who see them shall acknowledge them,
    that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.


[10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;
    my soul shall exult in my God,
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;
    he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,
    and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
[11] For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,
    and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
    to sprout up before all the nations. (ESV)
