He made me realise everything I have learned, every topic I have contemplated, and nearly every thought I have ever had could be of service to Him.

Somehow, I believe I will have a blast serving Him as well, and the only thing I can think about from the moment that I wake up to the moment that I go to sleep is how to serve Him. ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤
