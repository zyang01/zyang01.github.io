I'm pretty sure Prof Schrödinger is busy enough with all his dunno-if-dead-or-alive cats already, could we just leave the man alone to contemplate his mistakes on atheism?

Did your simulation-reality duality ever collapse into a simulation when you made the observation during flight turbulence or when you were starving?

Let me know if it did and would be interested to learn more. 🙏🫶😘

Proverbs 1:22-33

[22] “How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?

How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing

and fools hate knowledge? 

[23] If you turn at my reproof,

behold, I will pour out my spirit to you;

I will make my words known to you. 

[24] Because I have called and you refused to listen,

have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded, 

[25] because you have ignored all my counsel

and would have none of my reproof, 

[26] I also will laugh at your calamity;

I will mock when terror strikes you, 

[27] when terror strikes you like a storm

and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,

when distress and anguish come upon you. 

[28] Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;

they will seek me diligently but will not find me. 

[29] Because they hated knowledge

and did not choose the fear of the LORD, 

[30] would have none of my counsel

and despised all my reproof, 

[31] therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way,

and have their fill of their own devices. 

[32] For the simple are killed by their turning away,

and the complacency of fools destroys them; 

[33] but whoever listens to me will dwell secure

and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.”
