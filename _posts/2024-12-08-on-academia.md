Through my discussions with a couple of academics, I discovered something quite interesting after comparing my conversations with everyday folks from all sorts of different backgrounds throughout the week. I use a lot of simple everyday analogies to convey philosophical ideas so that they can be understood by almost everyone who did not have a formal education in philosophy, except the academics with a PhD on their rÃ©sumÃ© somewhere, not necessarily always in their titles.

The most frequent reply I received from them was I don't understand, and the most frequent complaint I received was my arguments were not formal enough or just a sandwich without fillings. I must admit I'm an amateur WhatsApp philosopher at best and the reason why I spoke to the academics in the first place was hoping to fill in my sandwich with their help, but their obsessions over formalities seem to hinder them from seeing the point that I believe can be conveyed easily to a five-year-old.

Christmas and New Year are coming up, so why not try that next time you encounter a five-year-old family relative at Christmas dinner and see if you could explain your work to them? What exactly are you contributing to society if all you do is hide behind fancy jargon and serious journal publications and receive compliments from your fellow esteemed academics in ivory towers? Sounds like you're just feeding your own intellectual pride and ego from each other. But then again, who am I to judge? I'm just an amateur WhatsApp philosopher at best.

They also seem to lack a sense of humour and don't understand sarcasm very well. ðŸ¤”

Matthew 23:1-12

Seven Woes to the Scribes and Pharisees

[1] Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, [2] â€œThe scribes and the Pharisees sit on Mosesâ€™ seat, [3] so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. [4] They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on peopleâ€™s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. [5] They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, [6] and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues [7] and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. [8] But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. [9] And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. [10] Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. [11] The greatest among you shall be your servant. [12] Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
