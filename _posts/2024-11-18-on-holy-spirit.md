I asked one of my guides, the Christian missionary in mainland China, how does the Holy Spirit manifest Himself to believers.

My guide told me that it’s different for everyone, the manifestation could be auditory, visual, sensorial or it could also just be distinct thoughts in the mind.

Personally, He manifests Himself to me via a distinct sensation. The analogy I use for explaining to friends is the pain that you feel when you pinch yourself. Based on the force applied, you can feel a spectrum of pain from mild to severe. For me, that spectrum of distinct sensation allows me to confirm thoughts and ideas. Believe it or not, all of my seemingly insane actions in the last eight weeks were always guided by the Holy Spirit, confirmed with at least one of my guides, as well as supported by scripture. When I have a super strong confirmation from the Holy Spirit, I wouldn’t even be able to speak and would feel like I’m getting a massage inside my skull. 🤤

As one of my guides told me, whatever it is that you do, do it with love, faith and hope. 🙏🫶😘

Edit: the other analogy I use is, the Holy Spirit is my GPS and the bible contains the user manual that teaches me how to follow His guidance.
