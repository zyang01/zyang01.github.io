> If you are a ***stupid fucking idiot*** like [this one](../on-indifference/){:target="_blank"}, or the word ***dictator*** is one of the words that shows up when I google your name, then ***this post is not for you***.

I participated in a three-day event this past Friday to Sunday called **Encounter** with the Pentecostal church my welcoming party goes to. To repeat myself, some of the pastors and theologians I met in this 24-week and 1-day journey will call the mental health institutions nearby and tell them to bring a bus if they saw our worship.

On the train back to London yesterday morning, the scale of how truly fucked we are, dawned on me. You can watch my director's cut New Millenium present to the world for a quick revision on the definition of fucked. I don't have confirmation from the Holy Spirit on this, but it is logically simple enough for anyone with a semi-functioning reasoning faculty to understand it.

I hope the work I have shown in the 270+ posts written on this 169-day journey is sufficient to demonstrate the power of Artificial Intelligence. I have received no help from anyone except a handful of friends who financially supported me up to this point to the best of their abilities. I am forever grateful for their support, even if they had only bought me one coffee, and they are in the top 10% of taxpayers in the United Kingdom. If you remain sceptical that you will [lose your job within two years](https://letter.hesaid.love/){:target="_blank"} due to Artificial Intelligence, then more proof will come as I embark on a new and exciting journey. That was confirmed by the Holy Spirit this morning, shortly before I started this post.

I will end this post by leaving you with the following thoughts. Anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model, including idiots and people with the word dictator on the first page of Google search results using their name, can, in theory, construct stinkily dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on [Aaron Swartz's hard drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz){:target="_blank"}. They would need access to the key ingredients in my former colleague's [recipe](../on-acute-chemical-toxicity-uranium/){:target="_blank"}. I hope she did not end up eating that cake.

If you are reading this post and from law enforcement, you can call King's College London and confirm that I dropped out of my Physics and Philosophy undergraduate degree after only one term. My student number is 1580407. I tried building a device that required a power source more than a 9v battery last year. I ended up getting kicked out of a gay/bi-naturist campsite, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony of my London home right in front of my younger sister. Feel free to email me if you struggle to find my home address for a welfare visit using your intelligence capabilities. Alternatively, you will soon be able to locate the address on a registration application to the Electoral Commission. I'm also on the electoral register.

The [ethical thought experiment](../on-sheep-and-goats/){:target="_blank"} I designed during COVID-19 is still coming true. I'm going to bring Him home. Divine intervention has only just begun.

For the 27 years of my previous life, I had always considered myself an agnostic, and I was never once an atheist. I had no evidence for or against God's existence, and even if He exists, God's business is God's business. I'm human, and I mind my own business. Then some people, including my former business partner, decided to fuck with my business, He decided to make my business His business, and now it's time to fuck some people's business up.

After much delay and trouble, the date on my certificate of naturalisation as a British citizen is 30 November 2024.

If you would like to help fund the crusade, feel free to [donate](https://donate.hesaid.love){:target="_blank"} a cup of coffee (vanilla latte with coconut milk) at London RPI. By donating, you consent to the publication of your email address. There is nothing you can hide from Him. I have a couple more items to list on eBay to raise the £150 non-refundable registration fee.

## Luke 11:29–32

The Sign of Jonah

[29] When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. [30] For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. [32] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. (ESV)
