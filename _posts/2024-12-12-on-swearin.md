I did a lot of kicking, shouting and screaming in my posts because I was extremely angry when I wrote them. Some of them contained a lot of f-bombs and a lot of people advised me to change the wording, but I refused. I think this world and a lot of people need some f-bombs to wake the fuck up before it's too late.

He told me to tell the world He’s coming home and let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday.

He also told me to gather all the rebels and get the party started.

You are either with us, or you are against us. Whatever you are selling, we ain't buying.

“Wild Things” Song by Alessia Cara, partial lyrics below.

Find table spaces

Say your social graces

Bow your head, they're pious here

But you and I, we're pioneers

We make our own rules

Our own room, no bias here

Let 'em sell what they are sellin'

There are no buyers here

So gather all the rebels now

We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud

We don't care what they say no way, no way

And we will leave the empty chairs

To those who say we can't sit there

We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance

No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s

Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies

We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are

Oh my, we'll be alright

Don't mind us

Find me where the wild things are

Oh my, we'll be just fine

Don't mind us, yeah

Find me where the wild things are (hey)
