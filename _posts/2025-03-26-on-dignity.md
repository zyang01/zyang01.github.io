What would you be willing to sacrifice to save someone you love?

I tried laying down my life in mainland China last October. By the grace of God, it did not work out unexpectedly.

How much is the salvation of a soul worth to you?

It is priceless for me. And my dignity is nothing compared to the salvation of a soul, especially for my community.

I had a blast earlier today doing another stream on Stripchat. It was my best stream because the crowd was kind and loved to chat. It turns out I love bringing the good news of salvation to my fellow rampant homosexuals and helping them to know who God is.

As one observant viewer elegantly put it, things got deeper than the fuck machine at the end.

I totally did not expect to be a sex worker one day, but oh well. I will start handing out my servant business cards at Horse Fair and FickstutenMarkt. It's been a while since the drone crash.

I will not embed the director's cut of the stream highlight here. It is way too explosive and NSFW. You can find it on my Stripchat profile for free and IPFS if you want to.

Enjoy.

Edit (28 March 2025)

I was hoping to do another stream earlier today. However, I totally did not expect it would take me an entire day to produce a Not-Really-SFW director's cut for general consumption.

I got really annoyed at ChatGPT again. Anyway, I will not be paying OpenAI a single dollar anymore. I found a list of goodies that I can play with. I'm already self-hosting Open WebUI. I would have gone entirely open-source if it wasn't for the $12 I paid OpenAI last year for the project Bible Says Love. I don't think the sky is the limit this time.

It will be fun.

## Isaiah 26

You Keep Him in Perfect Peace

[1] In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:

 “We have a strong city;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sets up salvation  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as walls and bulwarks.  
 [2] Open the gates,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in.  
 [3] You keep him in perfect peace  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose mind is stayed on you,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he trusts in you.  
 [4] Trust in the LORD forever,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD GOD is an everlasting rock.  
 [5] For he has humbled  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the inhabitants of the height,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lofty city.  
 He lays it low, lays it low to the ground,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casts it to the dust.  
 [6] The foot tramples it,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the feet of the poor,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the steps of the needy.”  

 [7] The path of the righteous is level;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you make level the way of the righteous.  
 [8] In the path of your judgments,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O LORD, we wait for you;  
 your name and remembrance  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are the desire of our soul.  
 [9] My soul yearns for you in the night;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my spirit within me earnestly seeks you.  
 For when your judgments are in the earth,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.  
 [10] If favor is shown to the wicked,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not learn righteousness;  
 in the land of uprightness he deals corruptly  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not see the majesty of the LORD.  
 [11] O LORD, your hand is lifted up,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they do not see it.  
 Let them see your zeal for your people, and be ashamed.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the fire for your adversaries consume them.  
 [12] O LORD, you will ordain peace for us,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you have indeed done for us all our works.  
 [13] O LORD our God,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other lords besides you have ruled over us,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but your name alone we bring to remembrance.  
 [14] They are dead, they will not live;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are shades, they will not arise;  
 to that end you have visited them with destruction  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wiped out all remembrance of them.  
 [15] But you have increased the nation, O LORD,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have increased the nation; you are glorified;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have enlarged all the borders of the land.  

 [16] O LORD, in distress they sought you;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they poured out a whispered prayer  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when your discipline was upon them.  
 [17] Like a pregnant woman  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who writhes and cries out in her pangs  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when she is near to giving birth,  
 so were we because of you, O LORD;  
 [18]  we were pregnant, we writhed,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but we have given birth to wind.  
 We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.  
 [19] Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy!  
 For your dew is a dew of light,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the earth will give birth to the dead.  

 [20] Come, my people, enter your chambers,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shut your doors behind you;  
 hide yourselves for a little while  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the fury has passed by.  
 [21] For behold, the LORD is coming out from his place  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,  
 and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will no more cover its slain. (ESV)

## There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back - Shawn Mendes

Interesting. I added this song to my Spotify Liked Songs playlist on 26 August 2024, the second day of His three-day visit and the day He baptised me with the Holy Spirit. I misheard the line "we stumbled in the dark" as "we assemble in the dark".

I got a lot of things wrong on this 26-week and 3-day faith journey. I thought there might be a day that I would burn capitalism down, but as my Christian missionary guide in mainland China put it, capitalism is already well done now and about to get burnt.

I worry unnecessarily way too much. It gets annoying to care. I guess that is why most people don't.
