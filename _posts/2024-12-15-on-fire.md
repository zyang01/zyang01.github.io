Show time. Time to set this world on fire and light em up.

“My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)” - Song by Fall Out Boy

Ooh oh oh oh, ooh oh oh oh

Be careful making wishes in the dark

Can't be sure when they've hit their mark

And besides in the mean-meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart

I'm in the de-details with the devil

So now the world can never get me on my level

I just got to get you out of the cage

I'm a young lovers rage

Gonna need a spark to ignite

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up up up, light em up up up

Light em up up up, I'm on fire

So light em up up up, light em up up up

Light em up up up, I'm on fire

Ooh oh oh oh (in the dark-dark)

Ooh oh oh oh (in the dark-dark)

All the writers keep writing what they write

Somewhere another pretty vein just dies

I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see

That you're the antidote to everything, except for me

A constellation of tears on your lashes

Burn everything you love

Then burn the ashes

In the end everything collides

My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up up up, light em up up up

Light em up up up, I'm on fire

So light em up up up, light em up up up

Light em up up up, I'm on fire

Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark-dark)

Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark-dark)

My songs know what you did in the dark

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up up up, light em up up up

Light em up up up, I'm on fire

So light em up up up, light em up up up

Light em up up up, I'm on fire

Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark-dark)

Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark-dark)

Ooh oh oh
