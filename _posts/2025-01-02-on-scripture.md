I had a major existential crisis for the first time concerning scripture after the strong drink by Thomas earlier this week.

As alluded to in my posts, Iâ€™m super lazy and haven't spent much time sitting down and reading scripture. That's why I built the project Bible Says Love (BibleSays.Love) in the first place. I was cheating with ChatGPT and wanted to share my cheating methods so that as many people can suit up ASAP considering the suffering that is to come if I'm unfortunately right about AI.

Despite the doubts and questions stirred up by the strong drink, I knew I would be okay because He said He would catch me and won't let me fall too far and nothing I do would make Him turn His back on me.

In the last 14 weeks and 4 days as a Christian intern, I had lost count of the number of times where the random sermon I went to somehow resolved a major issue that I had in mind, or would provide a path for the issue that was to come within a week. I don't even need to read scripture proactively, Dude will shove scripture in my face to clear the doubts in my head whenever I need it. ðŸ™„

As mentioned previously, I don't think any human being should have the authority to decide what scripture means. I think it's okay to ask for help interpreting it, but everyone should read scripture themselves and context should not be neglected. Speaking from personal experience, it seems like as long as your faith is strong enough, He would also help with your inability to study His Word by shoving passages in your face.

In an ideal scenario, I would prefer to memorize scripture, but I think 3 Bibles on my bed and 2 Bibles in my bag should be sufficient for a less than 15-week-old Christian intern.

Colossians 3:12-17

[12] Put on then, as Godâ€™s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, [13] bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. [14] And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. [15] And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. [16] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. [17] And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
