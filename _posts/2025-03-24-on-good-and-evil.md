[Here](../on-background-music/#definition-of-good){:target="_blank"} is a quick reminder of the definition of good from my early teenage years. The TL;DR is to wet my pants rather than cross the road at a red light.

I published [the post](https://uncensoredmodels.com){:target="_blank"} on uncensored models this past weekend after learning that one could get an uncensored large language model up and running with a handful of commands in minutes, subject to the download speed of their internet connection. Technically, anyone can start making devices that resemble the word boobs.

In case you have not read my posts—which I would not expect you to have—I spent the last decade studying four undergraduate degrees in mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. I also cooked solid-state rocket fuels when I was in high school. Frankly, I should be on a list somewhere if I am not already.

I got kicked out of a gay/bi-naturist campsite last July, and due to the unfaithfulness of a former business partner, I had to move all of my camping equipment back to my London flat. As of the moment of writing, I have six 3D printers in my flat, including a Bambu X1-Carbon with AMS, which I'm forbidden from selling due to bankruptcy proceedings. I also have enough camping equipment, which allowed me to survive outdoors for three months without stepping foot outside of the campsite, and an abundance of electrical equipment that enabled me to run a solo IT department for a campsite with a max capacity of 200+ guests and give them full Wi-Fi coverage for free.

If this is anyone else, I think some people should start writing to their MP and be very worried by now. If Boss Man didn't show up last August to save me, I would have thrown myself off the fifth-floor balcony in my flat more than a dozen times. But, being the delusional nutjob that I am, I instead chose to put up some nipples, spam people with clickbait campaigns, [keep emailing](../on-forgiveness/){:target="_blank"} some people and hope they would repent and turn from their evil ways. And my rent is six months overdue.

You tell me if I know how to spell good and evil.

I am always an ass man and never a boobs guy anyway.

## 1 Peter 3:8–22

Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake

[8] Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. ***[9] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.*** [10] For

 “Whoever desires to love life  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and see good days,  
 let him keep his tongue from evil  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his lips from speaking deceit;  
 [11] let him turn away from evil and do good;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him seek peace and pursue it.  
 [12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his ears are open to their prayer.  
 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”  

 [13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.

[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
