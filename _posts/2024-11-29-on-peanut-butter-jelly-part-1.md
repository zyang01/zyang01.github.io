The King of whacky ideas and the King of Drama told me to spread it like peanut butter jelly. So please allow me to introduce project Peanut Butter Jelly, Part 1.

GitHub repo: https://github.com/zyang01/PeanutButterJelly

Dude said He ain't gonna give me a dollar, but told me to get a drone for airdropping the gospel and testimony. 🤷

Feel free to use/modify any of the files/images and make it rain. Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday.

If you wanna know why I didn't spend the money on rent or living essentials. It's because His will precedes mine and I know He will care for me.

We are coming for you and you will have no excuse on that day if you choose to turn away. 🙏

2 Thessalonians 1:8-9

[8] in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. [9] They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,

John 12:48

[48] The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.

2 Peter 3:9

[9] The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.

Edit: check local rules and regulations concerning drones and DO NOT ENDANGER PEOPLE OR AIRCRAFTS. 🙏🫶😘
