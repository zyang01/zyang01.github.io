I just got served a humble pie by my former employer after [steak](../on-steak){:target="_blank"}. They called the police and two officers arrived to have a friendly conversation with me and to help me do a quick inventory of my camping gear. I estimate around 70% of the information they received was either factually incorrect or taken out of context, but to be fair, I foolishly left those openings for my former employer to exploit by my [overly dramatic writing style](../on-second-coming-official){:target="_blank"} and [choice of memes](../on-swearin){:target="_blank"}.

I will pay more attention to my choice of metaphors going forward and be more selective when it comes to memes. Quality over quantity essentially, but I won't change a single word that's been written, since they are a crucial part of my testimony.

The two officers seem genuinely nice and I know at least one of them will be reading my posts. We shook hands before I departed from Soho Square with tears in my eyes. I didn't cry for myself, I cried for my former colleagues since I had a good time working with them.

I prayed for the salvation of my former colleagues as well as those two officers. I must admit I had been rather aggressive this time and might have crossed a line in the heat of the moment. My sincere apologies to my former employer. I will be moving on and shaking off the dust from my feet. I'm content with the possibility of saving the officers.

I seem to get along quite well with law enforcement in general and the two officers also softened their tone like the officers in mainland China when [I turned myself into three Chinese police stations and brought them the message the People’s Republic of China will be overthrown in 40 days](../reasoning-behind-preaching-mainland-china-jonah-style){:target="_blank"}.

Ezekiel 3:18-19

[18] If I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. [19] But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.

Matthew 10:14-15

[14] And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. [15] Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.

Exodus 20:16

[16] “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

Edit: add the ninth commandment.
