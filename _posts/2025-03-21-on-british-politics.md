> 22 March 2025 Update: See the post [On Carpentry](../on-carpentry/){:target="_blank"}.

As alluded to, I am getting involved in British politics as yet another pretentious Oxford grad and massive hypocrite.

A faithful theologian friend suggested yesterday that I could join one of the 300+ political parties in the United Kingdom. I could get some experience in politics and learn the ropes that way.

I did another cost-benefit analysis.

If I fail, I'm not doing His will. I lose the £150 non-refundable registration fee plus some change. I become a laughing stock if I'm not one already, and Boss Man takes up residence in a handful of minds for 30 seconds.

If I succeed in walking into British politics completely blind, leaning not on my own understanding, and trusting Him to guide me completely, I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate the power of God than that.

It sounds like a good deal to me. 🤔

Let's turn up the love.

## 2 Corinthians 12:9–10

**[9] But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.** [10] For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong. (ESV)
