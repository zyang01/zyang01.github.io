In the last 72 hours, over 55,000 email addresses in the United Kingdom received a letter from me. The latest version of the letter can be found on [BibleSays.Love/letter](https://biblesays.love/letter){:target="_blank"} and I’m pretty sure I broke the view counter on YouOweMeACoffee(dot)com. If you work for the company Buy Me a Coffee and would like some help fixing your view counter and server-side concurrency issues then feel free to reach out. I'm quite free nowadays doing nothing but [posting memes on LinkedIn to annoy people](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-troublemaker-yang/recent-activity/all/){:target="_blank"}. 😉

I received some replies asking how I managed to find their email addresses. Unfortunately, that is between the Lord and me. Why don't you [ask Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A9-13&version=NIV){:target="_blank"}? 🙏

I was planning to apply the same methodology to other English-speaking countries, but I got quite annoyed cleaning the various datasets from different jurisdictions. Earlier this morning, the [King of whacky ideas](../on-peanut-butter-jelly-part-1){:target="_blank"} gave me a new approach. I have got some email infrastructure to set up and a letter, a warning and Christmas presents to deliver to 300-600 million email addresses worldwide.

That’s my Christmas holiday sorted. 🫨

Matthew 3:3

[3] For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,

“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:

‘Prepare the way of the Lord;

make his paths straight.’”
