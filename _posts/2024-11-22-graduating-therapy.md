Today marks the end of my 3+ years of therapy sessions with my Christ bro therapist.

I briefly discussed the reason why I started therapy and my therapy experience in my previous posts. In case you are wondering, I didn't start therapy due to mental illness is the takeaway here.

It was a happy ending between two Christ bros (God’s children), and I might still book an appointment from time to time just to catch up. I was joking with friends that I should start charging my Christ bro therapist for the reverse therapy that I have been doing for recent sessions. Our sessions have evolved to a degree where anything I tell my fellow Christ bro only causes distress and concern for him, while I'm happy as a five-year-old every day and go to bed around 9 pm. You can speculate on the reason after reading my previous post titled “On Mental Illness and Modern Psychology”. It is my personal opinion that modern psychology has gone seriously wrong without God.

A personal shoutout to Fraser, my therapist for 3+ years of professional and personal care. I wouldn't have made it this far without you and please don't worry about me. Have faith in the King of therapy, whose therapy sessions I will be attending daily if not hourly. 🙏🥹😉

Lastly, congratulations to Dr. Jordan Peterson on his new book “We Who Wrestle with God: Perceptions of the Divine”. In my humble opinion, Dr. Jordan Peterson is a very talented biblical scholar and I have learned a great deal about modern psychology from a biblical point of view. However, I have a personal message for Dr. Peterson - could we just not?

Galatians 5:19-24

[19] Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, [20] idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, [21] envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. [22] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, [23] gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. [24] And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
