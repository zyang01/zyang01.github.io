If you don't know me personally and you have read my recent posts where I dropped a ton of f-bombs, you are not going to believe it when I tell you that I rarely remember a time I was angry and absolutely pissed off since puberty, until this journey.

Dude definitely gave me a bad temper. 🙄🤔🤷

Ephesians 4:26-27

[26] Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, [27] and give no opportunity to the devil.

Matthew 21:12-13

Jesus Cleanses the Temple

[12] And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. [13] He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers.”

Psalm 145:8-9

[8] The LORD is gracious and merciful,

slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. 

Psalm 7:11-17

[11] God is a righteous judge,

and a God who feels indignation every day.

[12] If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword;

he has bent and readied his bow; 

[13] he has prepared for him his deadly weapons,

making his arrows fiery shafts. 

[14] Behold, the wicked man conceives evil

and is pregnant with mischief

and gives birth to lies. 

[15] He makes a pit, digging it out,

and falls into the hole that he has made. 

[16] His mischief returns upon his own head,

and on his own skull his violence descends.

[17] I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness,

and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.
