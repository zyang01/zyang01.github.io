There is another reason why I went all-in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour after reading Romans 1-4 besides the letter telling me what I did wrong.

As mentioned in my blog real-life-fantasy(dot)com, I saved a person from drug overdose on my first night in Berlin using the techniques I learned from the bouncer at a LGBT venue in Amsterdam. That venue is called Club Church and please send my regards to the bouncer next time you’re there.

I call myself a rampant homosexual because I’m what’s known as a bad gay even amongst my community. Most of my travel destinations over the last 12 months or so are major European LGBT destinations and I spent a substantial amount of time in sex venues. These venues can be rather dark for acts of abomination. Over the six months period that I travelled, I estimate there were over a handful of times where I had to call the staff because someone was passing out and no one, absolutely freaking none, cared about that person’s wellbeing.

And therefore, that Sunday morning when I read Romans 1-4, I felt the truth in my bones when reading the following passage.

Romans 1:22-32

[22] Claiming to be wise, they became fools, [23] and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.

[24] Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, [25] because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.

[26] For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; [27] and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.

[28] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. [29] They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, [30] slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, [31] foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. [32] Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.

That being said, I still believe I’m a homosexual and just because I’m a Christian doesn’t mean I’m straight now. We all fall short of the glory of God, and yet He still loves us no matter what. Just repent please? 🙏🫶😘
