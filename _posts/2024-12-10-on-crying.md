I could probably count the number of times I have cried in the last 15 years since puberty with both hands before I met the Big Man.

Ever since knowing Him, I have turned into a gigantic crybaby and cry my eyes out every other day, mainly due to words and actions from unbelievers including both of my parents.

Back when I could still afford Uber, I was waiting for my ride outside Burnt Oak station in northwest London one evening next to the bus stop. A man was standing next to me waiting for the bus and eating some chips. I could tell he just got off work from his clothing and I could sense the tiredness from his body language. My eyes got wet because he was hungry and eating too fast and I was worried that he might choke. I wanted to tell him to slow down, take his time and chew slowly.

What's happening to me?

Psalm 42:1-3

Book Two

Why Are You Cast Down, O My Soul?

To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah.

[1] As a deer pants for flowing streams,

so pants my soul for you, O God. 

[2] My soul thirsts for God,

for the living God.

When shall I come and appear before God? 

[3] My tears have been my food

day and night,

while they say to me all the day long,

“Where is your God?”

Psalm 34:17-22

[17] When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears

and delivers them out of all their troubles. 

[18] The LORD is near to the brokenhearted

and saves the crushed in spirit.

[19] Many are the afflictions of the righteous,

but the LORD delivers him out of them all. 

[20] He keeps all his bones;

not one of them is broken. 

[21] Affliction will slay the wicked,

and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. 

[22] The LORD redeems the life of his servants;

none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.

Revelation 21:4

[4] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”
