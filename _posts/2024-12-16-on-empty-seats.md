I attended four services in four different churches this past weekend. I get extremely annoyed when I see empty seats, especially on a rainy day. You can’t go to church because it’s raining? Does that excuse fly with your earthly boss? If it doesn’t then why should it fly with your Heavenly Boss?

In my humble opinion, if your earthly boss doesn’t allow you to take the day off then you have no excuse for not making the effort to make it to church.

Again, the correct day to observe the Sabbath is Saturday, but there are too many mistakes so let's fix one at a time.

Exodus 20:10-11

[10] but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. [11] For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
