My date of birth is 8 Nov 1996, in case you wanna call/email Drug Test London to verify the drug test result in my previous post titled ‚ÄúOn Drugs‚Äù.

If you are an identity thief, feel free to pay my approximately ¬£100,000 credit card debt when you log into my online banking. The main chunk is over at Amex, don't forget it please. Your kind donation would be greatly appreciated. üôè

Now that we have got the soundness of mind and my financial affairs clarified, feel free to have a read on all of my posts and tell me if you think I have gone insane or not. üòâ

1 Peter 4:1-6

Stewards of God‚Äôs Grace

[1] Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, [2] so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. [3] For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry. [4] With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; [5] but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. [6] For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.

1 Corinthians 1:18-25

Christ the Wisdom and Power of God

[18] For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. [19] For it is written, 

‚ÄúI will destroy the wisdom of the wise,

and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.‚Äù

[20] Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? [21] For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. [22] For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, [23] but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, [24] but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. [25] For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

Mark 3:20-21

[20] Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. [21] And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, ‚ÄúHe is out of his mind.‚Äù
