The only thing I knew about the publishing industry 24 hours ago was they printed books.

I pulled another all-nighter again last night. I hope I can stop that soon.

The order of events I remember after staring at a handful of pages for 24 hours is roughly the following.

---

Frances Haugen

Jane Friedman

Sinister Malefactor of Panglossian Expectations

An annoyingly bitter, sarcastic and relatable welcoming letter

Someone had some issues with getting emails delivered

Beautiful poetry on Sartre's gastrointestinal problems

Some news about Lit Mag

Something about post road

A whole lot on AI and various other matters in between
