Three months ago I thought I had the happiest two months of my life in the gay/bi naturist campsite rosebay and getting kicked out smashed my heart into pieces. I later realised I spent those two months in hell and the happiest time of my life is right now walking with my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and dancing with Him every day.

I have Google Analytics enabled on my site YouOweMeACoffee(dot)com and I can also see visitor statistics on my blog real-life-fantasy(dot)com. I saw people from Saudi Arabia are visiting and I hope they are believers. However, if anyone would like to chop me into pieces or poison me, feel free to have a go at it and let’s see if your worldly poison can beat my Lord’s protection. I would love to meet my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ anyway.

He told me I can walk through hell with a smile, because He will always be by my side. 🙏🫶😘

Mark 16:16-18

[16] Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. [17] And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; [18] they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”

Edit: if you don't know what I'm talking about, google the name Jamal Khashoggi.
