I'm just going to present some very interesting objective facts I found prior to my global tour, but I won't comment on them since most of my readers probably think that I have gone batshit crazy already. I won't add fuel to the fire this time. ðŸ˜¬

The names of the couple that owns Rosebay Naturist Camping are John Donald and Dean Wilson. Using John's age and the information that they previously ran a hotel in Blackpool, I found a company they previous controlled on companies house called Local Select Limited (registration number 06023905). And you can see the details via [this link](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06023905/officers){:target="_blank"}.

I also found an Anglican priest by the name John Donald Wilkinson on Wikipedia and you can read about him via [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donald_Wilkinson){:target="_blank"}.

According to Wikipedia, John Donald Wilkinson served a three-year curacy at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, London from 1956 till 1959.

I absolutely hated telling people which secondary school I went to in London, because not a lot of English speakers know how to spell Dunstan. I went to St Dunstan's College in Catford, London.

Please find below my offer letter from Keble College, Oxford back in 2015 that was mailed to St Dunstan's College where I was studying at the time.

It's probably just a coincidence, right? ðŸ¤¡

Edit: hey John, maybe next time donâ€™t fuck with a 27yo with four jobs and four degrees who buys a brand new caravan when they donâ€™t even have a driving license alright? Otherwise, you might accidentally bring about judgement day or something. ðŸ¤·
