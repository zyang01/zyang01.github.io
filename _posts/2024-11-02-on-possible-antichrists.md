ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨Trigger WarningðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨: This post is likely to offend an entire nation if not multiple nations.

I had the usual suspects as possible antichrists on my list previously - Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Sam Altman, the president of a certain eastern nation, the pope, and even Dr. Jordan Peterson.

But the latest candidate on my list makes all of them seem insignificant, has control over substantial military forces and wealth measured in trillions, and global reach in the tech and financial sectors via sovereign wealth funds. He also hired a Chinese firm back in September to fly 6,000 drones and create a gigantic portrait of himself in the sky.

Details can be found in the article below.
