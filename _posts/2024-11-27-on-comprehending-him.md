You know how in natural sciences you need an instrument to measure or dissect the object you are trying to study and understand? That instrument often needs to be more precise than the object that you are measuring or dissecting.

Examples include you need a scalpel to study organs and you can't use a regular ruler with millimeter precision to measure atomic structures.

Let’s assume for the sake of argument that God exists, what in the universe that He created are you going to use as an instrument to measure and dissect?

1 Kings 8:27

[27] “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!

Isaiah 46:5

[5] “To whom will you liken me and make me equal,

and compare me, that we may be alike?

Job 11:7-9

[7] “Can you find out the deep things of God?

Can you find out the limit of the Almighty? 

[8] It is higher than heaven—what can you do?

Deeper than Sheol—what can you know? 

[9] Its measure is longer than the earth

and broader than the sea.

Romans 11:33-36

[33] Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!

[34] “For who has known the mind of the Lord,

or who has been his counselor?” 

[35] “Or who has given a gift to him

that he might be repaid?”

[36] For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.
