Originally I was planning to stop updating [my old blog](https://buymeacoffee.com/aaronyangi){:target="_blank"} hosted on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/){:target="_blank"} after the [migration to Cloudflare](../on-cloudflare){:target="_blank"}, but I just saw the visitor statistics on Google Analytics for this past week.

Brothers and sisters, I will keep you in my prayers and may the Lord give you strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. Hang in there. 🙏🫶😘💪💪💪💪

1 Thessalonians 5:11

[11] Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.

Hebrews 10:23-25

[23] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. [24] And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, [25] not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.

Colossians 3:12-16

[12] Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, [13] bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. [14] And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. [15] And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. [16] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
