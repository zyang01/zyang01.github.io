As mentioned in my previous posts, I [walked to the end of rational philosophy without God](../on-gdel-incompleteness-theorems/){:target="_blank"} and arrived at existentialism, nihilism and anti-natalism. I call them the three horsemen of rational philosophy and the fourth is death as always.

The issue with nihilism and lack of objective meaning, in general, is they imply there's no objective good and evil. I got to a point where I realised there's no difference between choosing and not choosing to pick up a knife and stab someone, it's merely a question of whether or not I could get away with it. Essentially good and evil are merely human constructs and another by-product of evolution. There is no ultimate accountability and as we have seen countless times in history, people with power and resources often roam outside the bounds of the law.

But if you open your eyes and look around, could you in good conscience say objective good and evil don't exist?

Isaiah 5:20-23

[20] Woe to those who call evil good

and good evil,

who put darkness for light

and light for darkness,

who put bitter for sweet

and sweet for bitter! 

[21] Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,

and shrewd in their own sight! 

[22] Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,

and valiant men in mixing strong drink, 

[23] who acquit the guilty for a bribe,

and deprive the innocent of his right!
