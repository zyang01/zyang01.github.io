I was absolutely fuming last night after realising how adulterous and unfaithful the world has become. I got so mad that I sent a ton of rather profane messages to a couple of my current friends and the former friend calling everyone a bunch of names that imply sexual immorality and promiscuity. I sincerely apologise to everyone as well as to my boss. I will continue to pray for Him to take my wrath away and hope that everyone could forgive my transgression last night. 🙏

I also nearly jumped on a flight to Israel and wanted to go to Jerusalem, find a tree, finish reading my bible, and just wait for Him to come back. The only thing that stopped me was my lack of financial resources and the tickets are more expensive than the cash I have in the bank.

It appears that we not only lost faith in God above, we also lost faith in each other. Everyone was more concerned about me not paying them back, when the only things I wanted were to clean up my mess, pay the rent that’s been overdue for an entire month, and I submitted a few applications on christiantechjobs.io yesterday including to the Bible Project.

When I got kicked out of the campsite, there were two questions in my head. Were those three months at the campsite divine intervention, because an ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID essentially came true? And could we bring God back?

I was being rather dramatic when it comes to the second question. I asked that because some German dude named Friedrich Nietzsche once said God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed Him. What I meant by the second question was could we restore faith in each other’s hearts and don’t by default assume we want something from each other for malicious or ill intent.

Matthew 6:24

[24] “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.

The answers to the two questions are yes and abso-freaking-lutely yes. Also I know which master most of my friends serve now. Don’t worry, there should still be time to repent, but tbh I don’t know when my boss is coming back. Could be tonight, could be tomorrow, could be 7 years down the line. But I will be ready, will you?

As always, best wishes and good luck. 🙏🫶😘

Have fun on judgement day if I don’t see you before. 🙏

Edit: I guess Dude must heard my second question. 🤔
