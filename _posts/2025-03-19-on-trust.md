As I have repeatedly alluded to, I did not trust myself even once in the first 27 years of my life. After this 25-week and 3-day journey, I believe I finally learned what the word _**trust**_ means. I believe I also know how to spell the word _**God**_.

If I'm worried, concerned or scared, I'm not trusting Him. I can solve all of my problems by trusting Him. I cannot logically explain that to you. It is simply something that I believe and know without a single doubt in my mind. That does not mean I can sit around and chill. I still need to do my part to the best of my abilities. And God knows I freaking love to try a ton of whacky ideas. Dude needs to pull me back most of the time and tell me to chill. But otherwise, what is the point of existing if I do nothing at all?

I can trust Him and endure all things, including death and the world turning on me because I know He knows better than me.

He is _**God**_. What do I have to worry about?

It feels freaking weird, but I have to admit I'm loving it, reluctantly.

I might just be one of the luckiest people alive.
