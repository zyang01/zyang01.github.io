As I have repeatedly alluded to, I did not trust myself even once in the first 27 years of my life. After this 25-week and 3-day journey, I believe I finally learned what the word _**trust**_ means. I believe I also know how to spell the word _**God**_.

If I'm worried, concerned or scared, I'm not trusting Him. I can solve all of my problems by trusting Him. I cannot logically explain that to you. It is simply something that I believe and know without a single doubt in my mind. That does not mean I can sit around and chill. I still need to do my part to the best of my abilities. And God knows I freaking love to try a ton of whacky ideas. Dude needs to pull me back most of the time and tell me to chill. But otherwise, what is the point of existing if I do nothing at all?

I can trust Him and endure all things, including death and the world turning on me because I know He knows better than me.

He is _**God**_. What do I have to worry about?

It feels freaking weird, but I have to admit I'm loving it, reluctantly.

I might just be one of the luckiest people alive.

Proverbs 3:1–12

Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart

 [1] My son, do not forget my teaching,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but let your heart keep my commandments,  
 [2] for length of days and years of life  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and peace they will add to you.  

 [3] Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bind them around your neck;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write them on the tablet of your heart.  
 [4] So you will find favor and good success  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the sight of God and man.  

 [5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not lean on your own understanding.  
 [6] In all your ways acknowledge him,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will make straight your paths.  
 [7] Be not wise in your own eyes;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.  
 [8] It will be healing to your flesh  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refreshment to your bones.  

 [9] Honor the LORD with your wealth  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the firstfruits of all your produce;  
 [10] then your barns will be filled with plenty,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your vats will be bursting with wine.  

 [11] My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or be weary of his reproof,  
 [12] for the LORD reproves him whom he loves,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a father the son in whom he delights. (ESV)
