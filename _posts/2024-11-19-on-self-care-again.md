Stop fucking loving yourself! Love the Lord your God and love your neighbours as yourself.

You don’t have to care for yourself through just looking after yourself you know? I believe that only promotes division, selfishness, pride and narcissism. By loving our neighbours and each other, we can rely on each other to take care of ourselves. I believe this kind of love unites rather than divides, and is way more effective.

The scripture also teaches us to love the Lord and our neighbours, and warns us against being lovers of ourselves.

Matthew 22:34-40

The Great Commandment

[38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”

2 Timothy 3:1-4

[2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
