I think this will be the last time for the foreseeable future where I beg for help online. If you want to offer me advice then you can go fuck yourself. 🖕

I'm gonna quote my Boss below. You are either with us or you are against us.

Matthew 12:30

[30] Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

Luke 11:23

[23] Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

Matthew 19:21

[21] Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”

Mark 10:21-22

[21] And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” [22] Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.

Luke 18:22-27

[22] When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” [23] But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. [24] Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, “How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! [25] For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” [26] Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” [27] But he said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”

Luke 12:33-34

[33] Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. [34] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

Luke 14:33

[33] So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.
