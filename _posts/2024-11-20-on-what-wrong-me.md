Too capable for my own good. ðŸ™„

Too impatient and run in front of my Boss all the time. ðŸ¤¦

Too loud and shameless. Kicking and screaming all the time as a spiritual baby. ðŸ‘¶ 

1 Peter 2:1-5

A Living Stone and a Holy People

[1] So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. [2] Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvationâ€”[3] if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.

[4] As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, [5] you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
