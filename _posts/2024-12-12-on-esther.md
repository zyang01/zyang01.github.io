As mentioned in my previous post titled “Reasoning Behind Preaching in Mainland China Jonah Style”, I jumped on a flight from London Heathrow to Hong Kong on the 2nd of October, my second week as a believer, with 3 Bibles in my bag and no change of underwear. I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church and spoke to pastor Xander before diving into the mainland for a 3-day mission.

After somehow miraculously returning to Hong Kong, I attended my second church service at the Hong Kong Baptist Church for their Saturday evening service and brought two Chinese high school friends with me. I almost pooped myself after reading the Bible passages for the sermon.

Esther 4:8-17

[8] Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people. [9] And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. [10] Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say, [11] “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law—to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.”

[12] And they told Mordecai what Esther had said. [13] Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not think to yourself that in the king’s palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. [14] For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” [15] Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, [16] “Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my young women will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish.” [17] Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.

I know I almost pooped myself a lot of times during my global tour, but did I just outdo a queen in the Old Testament?

He told me my book was unwritten even before I went all-in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour. I thought He offered me a way out since a book unwritten maybe doesn't need to be written at all, or it could be a book about someone else.

I’m not sure I want out anymore.

Edit: add a newline.
