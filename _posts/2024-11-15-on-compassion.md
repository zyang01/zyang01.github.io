Tbf, some of my posts do sound rather salty and bitter. I was a pretty crazy guy even before my walk with Christ. I think it’s fair to say not everyone tries to complete the holy trinity of eduction by getting degrees in sciences, humanities and arts. I can understand from an outsider’s perspective that I’m absolutely nuts, but then I just occasionally hope people can try to see things from my perspective is all.

I know it’s hard, sorry. 🙏🫶🥺

The only place I want to run to everyday is church. It’s the only place that brings me comfort nowadays. Since none of my friends are willing to help.

Matthew 5:13

[13] “You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people’s feet.
