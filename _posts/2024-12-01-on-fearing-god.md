If you are not a believer, then please ask yourself the following question.

Assuming a righteous God does indeed exist, do you fear His wrath and judgement?

If the answer is yes, then I strongly suggest you read all my posts and decide what you would like to do next.

Try not to leave it too late. Wouldn't be pretty if He comes back on the day you realised. 🙏🫶😘

Colossians 3:5-6

[5] Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. [6] On account of these the wrath of God is coming.

Edit: if the answer is no then could you comment below and let me know why? I'm very interested in the reasoning. 🤔🥹😘
