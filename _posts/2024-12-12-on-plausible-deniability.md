Do you like the new design? The new batch arrived yesterday and gonna shove them to a bunch of Baptist churches pulled off the GCP Places API. Gonna order 10,000 more after I sell some stuff.

I seem to get really into shoving things lately. Was exclusively on the receiving end when I was a rampant homosexual. ðŸ¤”

Anyway, if you see some 1.6g theological nuclear bombs flying around then it could be a Baptist minister or a naughty deacon playing with [balloons](../on-peanut-butter-jelly-part-2){:target="_blank"} or their [DJI drones](../on-peanut-butter-jelly-part-1){:target="_blank"}.

Colossians 4:2-6

Further Instructions

[2] Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. [3] At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prisonâ€”[4] that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.

[5] Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. [6] Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.
