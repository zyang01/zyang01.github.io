Back when I was running around like a headless chicken trying to convince people that I was telling the truth and I hadn't gone crazy, I designed a theological question to test whether the person I was talking to truly believed in God.

If God asks you to pick a side between Him and mankind when mankind has turned its back to God, which side would you choose?

My answer to that question at the time terrified me. I hope that day never comes, but I realised I would always choose God because He represents truth and righteousness, and if mankind turned its back on those two things then I would never side with mankind. The terror comes from the fact that there was more than one occasion in my life where my entire world was telling me I was wrong, but I still chose what I believed to be right and ended up proving I made the right choice.

Chaplain Beth at Regent‚Äôs Park College, Oxford provided further insights from a theological perspective and I realised God can always save mankind by miraculously turning someone as blind as me back to Him, and therefore hopefully mankind would never completely turn its back to God.

However, just because He loves us, doesn't mean we have a license to abuse His love. And if there comes a day that He asks me to burn this world down, no matter how reluctant I am, I believe I will do it.

If you are an unbeliever even after you have been exposed to the gospel, consider yourselves warned. üôè
