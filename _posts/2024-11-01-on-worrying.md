```
Psalm 23:4

    [4] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

        I will fear no evil,

    for you are with me;

    your rod and your staff,

    they comfort me.
```

He promised me that even if we are six feet underground, we will be safe and sound.

He’s coming back to burn the house down, and I’m gonna help Him. Are you with us, or against us?
