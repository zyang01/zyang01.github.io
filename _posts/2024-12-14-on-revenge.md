To be honest, I was extremely angry after walking out of the delivery office yesterday and finding out the packages were heading to Belfast for destruction.

I spent £104.79 on Tracked 24 and labelled the packages private and confidential so that management could have plausible deniability. They wouldn't have known the contents of the packages unless they opened them which would violate certain privacy laws. The packages were merely personal gifts from me to the people I worked with. And therefore I consider the act of refusing the packages irrational and done out of utter contempt. I also personally consider the act as blasphemy if they didn't inform the postman/postwoman where to return the packages to and if they do end up in Belfast for destruction.

He did tell me to kill them with kindness and said Troublemaker is my middle name. So ladies and gentlemen, let's dance, shall we?

In case the legal team is cooking up something interesting for me, please follow my advice in my previous posts and read my origin story on real-life-fantasy(dot)com. The TLDR is the more difficult you make it the more I enjoy coming up with whacky ideas and I freaking love an impossible challenge. I will have so much fun navigating legal and physical constraints to be as loud as possible when spreading the gospel. Just so you know, I already have a nuclear option in mind that I can get so much attention in Soho Square even without me being in the country. I just need to sell more stuff before I place further orders online.

Once again, have a go at me with all you've got. I'm gonna get the attention of more than two dozen former colleagues this time. I think management should start to wish they just signed for them the other day by now. 🤔🫣🙈

Leonardo DiCaprio and Matthew McConaughey were right, money is one hell of a drug.

I wonder why He called me. 🤔

Romans 12:19

[19] Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”

Deuteronomy 32:35

[35] Vengeance is mine, and recompense,

for the time when their foot shall slip;

for the day of their calamity is at hand,

and their doom comes swiftly.’

Romans 12:20-21

[20] To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” [21] Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

Ephesians 4:26-27

[26] Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, [27] and give no opportunity to the devil.
