On My Way
Song by Axwell & Ingrosso and Sebastian Ingrosso

[Verse]
No time to pretend
Dust off and try again
Straight out of lion's den
Strong as a thousand men

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what I've been told
Since I was six years old
Duck down and count to ten

[Chorus]
I'm gonna hit the throttle
I'm gonna place my bet on every step I take
Go tell everyone under the sun
I'm on my way
And if I hit rock bottom
I'm gonna smile and dance with every step I take
Go tell everyone under the sun
I'm on my way, on my way
I'm on my way, on my way
On, on, on my way
On, on, on my way
On, on, on my my
On my way
On my way

Joel 2:1-11

The Day of the LORD

    [1] Blow a trumpet in Zion;
        sound an alarm on my holy mountain!
    Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
        for the day of the LORD is coming; it is near, 
    [2] a day of darkness and gloom,
        a day of clouds and thick darkness!
    Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains
        a great and powerful people;
    their like has never been before,
        nor will be again after them
        through the years of all generations.

    [3] Fire devours before them,
        and behind them a flame burns.
    The land is like the garden of Eden before them,
        but behind them a desolate wilderness,
        and nothing escapes them.

    [4] Their appearance is like the appearance of horses,
        and like war horses they run. 
    [5] As with the rumbling of chariots,
        they leap on the tops of the mountains,
    like the crackling of a flame of fire
        devouring the stubble,
    like a powerful army
        drawn up for battle.

    [6] Before them peoples are in anguish;
        all faces grow pale. 
    [7] Like warriors they charge;
        like soldiers they scale the wall.
    They march each on his way;
        they do not swerve from their paths. 
    [8] They do not jostle one another;
        each marches in his path;
    they burst through the weapons
        and are not halted. 
    [9] They leap upon the city,
        they run upon the walls,
    they climb up into the houses,
        they enter through the windows like a thief.

    [10] The earth quakes before them;
        the heavens tremble.
    The sun and the moon are darkened,
        and the stars withdraw their shining. 
    [11] The LORD utters his voice
        before his army,
    for his camp is exceedingly great;
        he who executes his word is powerful.
    For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome;
        who can endure it?

    Return to the LORD
